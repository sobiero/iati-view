Thus the Programme will:support cities and communities, with demonstrated commitments, to take initiatives promoting investment in water and sanitation specifically targeted to the poorest of the poorprovide a fast track mechanism for reaching out to the urban poor and will provide a bridge for the urban poor to access benefits from citywide improvement which often bypass themaddress with priority requests for support from countries, that have low water and sanitation coverages in the regions that the programme has a presencePriority will also be given to community initiatives in support of sanitation provision and hygiene education. Special consideration will be given to initiatives that could reduce the burden of women and children in accessing safe water and adequate sanitation. The basic logic behind the Trust Fund\'s intervention is the following: development is a process of change and to be sustainable, change strategies must be locally owned; this in turn requires public awareness which results, if properly supported, in enhanced capacity in communities and cities, and in strengthened political will to adopt policies and regulations favourable to pro-poor investments. The mission of the Trust Fund is to support this process by contributing knowledge, expertise and material resources.');

The specific objective is to provide training, capacity-building and advocacy interventions for local administrations and local parliamentarians to better respond to the needs of uprooted women and IDPs in West Timor.  This objective should be framed with the aim of the Aid to Uprooted People and aims of the concurrent post-conflict programmes within the policies of the Indonesian government. Widespread conflict and displacement affected several regions of Indonesia, including Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West Timor, in the period 1998 and 2002. Healing and integration are still ongoing. In the case of West Timor the violent post-referendum phase in East Timor caused a large influx of pro-Indonesia fighters and sympathizers and their families, and other caught up. The influx took place in areas where traditional community conflicts had simmered for long, and where indigenous communities clashed with new elites, whether military or economic. Many of these local tensions were suppressed during the Suharto era, but erupted (and where often intentionally ignited) as of 1997. The East Timor crisis, however, caused a full blown political displacement crisis in West Timor.   The Indonesian Government expects that overall policies should now focus on ‘moving ahead’, on sustainable development. Conflict prevention and peace building was written in into national policies. The last National Medium Term Development Programme (2005-2009) called for a ‘safe and peaceful, just and democratic Indonesia with better welfare’. The present five-year plan is more specific, and calls for a special development focus on zones which are least developed, frontier, outer or post-conflict. In NTT, the government states that restitution issues have been dealt with and that peace consolidation is not at the order. Displaced people should become full citizens; they should be part of communities of citizens.        The present calls of the EU look for closure as well. The Aid to Uprooted People programme was delivering direct assistance to people affected by conflict and displacement. To phase out, in line with the expectations of the Indonesian Government, it now addresses the last groups of uprooted people which have failed to find for themselves or find assistance from others for a more secure future. These ‘most vulnerable’ are often women, children, female headed households and certain groups of indigenous people (or local people in hosting communities in general) which were also affected by the displacement crisis. The first 2010 call delivered assistance directly to communities. The second call was for improved monitoring and early warning capacity. The third and present call wants to assist local governments and elected officials to also deliver assistance, now and in the future');

In addition, a large percentage of displaced families that cannot afford to rent, live in informal settlements (9.5%), often in structures made from mud, sticks and other salvaged materials, or have occupied public buildings and former military camps (2.6%). These families are threatened with forceful eviction with no alternative accommodation available.[1] The target group benefitting from the project are IDPs and other vulnerable living within unplanned settlements in Baghdad. The project will directly benefit approximately 900 vulnerable families, predominantly IDPs that will access secure land tenure and improved living environment through government financed settlement upgrading. IDPs will benefit from technical assistance to a resettlement project in Mahmoudiya; and pending commitment from the Governor of Baghdad, IDP families in Bahith El Almi will also benefit from technical assistance related to the proposed land sharing project.

The project is designed to positively influence current practices in the building sector by promoting a systematic and comprehensive approach for stimulating a market demand for energy efficient buildings in the region.Although increased energy efficiency is highlighted as a key objective in many policy papers in the target countries, none of them has an energy efficiency law/bylaw/regulatory system for buildings and constructions. This project seeks: to mainstream energy efficiency into the existing legislation; and, to build on ongoing initiatives and develop an energy efficiency regulatory system for new and existing buildings. The project will also focus on green architecture, with the emphasis on effective policies, regulations and standards that integrate energy efficiency into building design.Without the intervention, no major improvement can be expected in the medium term in all the five countries. This project\'s regional approach will avoid duplication of efforts, will increase efficiency in the use of resources and will create competition among the countries for adopting and implementing of EEB\'s regulations. The strong awareness, capacity building and technical assistance that will link the government agencies cooperating with international experts will favor knowledge sharing and transfer.The project “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in East Africa” will include five inter-related components, namely:Component 1: Energy Efficiency Data and Benchmarks in the Building Sector. This component will address existing gaps in terms of consistent, relevant and adequate data of various types of buildings (all related to EEB) in the region. It will allow formulating benchmarks, as well as identifying opportunities and energy saving potentials. Component 2: Formulation and Adoption of Energy Efficiency Codes in Buildings. This component is the core of Promoting EEB in East Africa and will target the revision of the country specific building code and municipal by laws to include EEB with reference to the specific climatic zones. Moreover, toolkits and guidelines will be developed for the application of the building code, especially in related municipal by laws. Civil servants will be capacitated to administer the implementation of the new regulations. Component 3: Awareness Raising and Capacity Building in EE, and Best Practices in the Building Sector. This component rests on three main pillars, the awareness creation with the general public, the technical capacity building for professionals on EEB and the East African Energy Efficiency in Buildings Award, as an instrument to create regional recognition for architects, building owners, real estate developers and other actors that have adopted energy efficiency and green building criteria in their buildings. Component 4: Appropriate Financial Framework for the Promotion of EE Measures in Buildings. This component will focus on EEB finance, following an approach that includes top-level advocacy with the top-managements of commercial banks; training and capacity building on EEB finance; and the introduction of the green mortgage concept in the region. Green/EEB investment portfolios will be developed together with the banks. This component will also establish pilot financial mechanisms in all partner countries. Component 5: Development and Implementation of Pilot Projects. This project component will provide technical assistance to all ongoing governmental mass housings projects regarding the incorporation of EEB measures. In partner countries where the EEB code has been approved and adopted, the implementation of the code will be tested in reality and on scale. Operational models will be created for the mainstreaming. An advisory team will provide technical assistance in EEB with respect to planning, design and construction. Important concepts to be promoted will include natural lighting, ventilation and cooling systems; adequate building orientation, the use of sun shading devices; solar water heaters, energy saving lamps etc. The team will also advice on retrofitting existing buildings. The direct GHG emission reductions of this program will be achieved here.It is the projects assumption that the joint implementation of these interlinked components (jointly together with the National Governments and the EAC) in close cooperation with relevant projects by the international donor community will provide sufficient momentum for the achievement of the project objective.');

To meetthese challenges, the PSUP programme seeks to harmonize with local and nationalstakeholders on key slum upgrading projects through creating a network forregional slum upgrading challenges. For this purpose, regional training andpolicy seminars on the programme\'s concept, themes, and methods will beorganized with all stakeholders involved. The programme also aims to supportlocal and national authorities in identifying adequate funding to carry outspecific activities.Objective 1: To enablenational, city and community representatives and planning authorities to assessurban development needs and urban poverty in ACP countries through applyingcross-sector approaches and building ownership for the urban sector challenges– this includes the acknowledgement of informal settlements as an integral partof cities, and with the population therein addressed through a rights-basedapproach.Particularly,municipalities and line ministries responsible for urban development lack humanand financial resources for urban governance and management. Actions in urbanareas lack coordination and often there is duplication of efforts addressingthe same context with very limited resources. Further, apart from strengtheninginstitutions to address urban poverty in an appropriate way, a link betweenfinancing and technical government bodies is essential to finance urban povertyin a sustainable way, also beyond this action.Objective 2: To empowerACP countries national, city and community representatives as well as planningauthorities to address slum dwellers\' needs for better living conditions intheir cities with adequate planning tools and realistic resource mobilizationstrategies – addressing and including the slum population directly in designingslum upgrading programmes.Often the identificationof slum upgrading needs lack continuation, implementation and the participationof the target group. The formulation of slum upgrading projects is oftenisolated and sector specific. This often leads to single projects improving livingconditions in the short-term or even leading to conflicts and negative impactson the ground.The capacity to developslum upgrading programmes in an integrated and participatory manner under theleadership of the government and in the context of the whole city or town, withits overall development opportunities, is not taken care off.In addition, policy andregulatory frameworks often hinder sustainable and affordable urbaninfrastructure, land and housing (from plot sizes, land regulations or secure tenureand housing building codes to provision of basic services). This programme aimsat overcoming divides of the informal and formal city and improvement atnational and city or town level.Objective 3: Empowernational, city and community representatives and planning authorities toimplement innovative slum upgrading programmes that demonstrate successful slumupgrading interventions which are to be up-scaled and replicated in othertowns, cities and neighbourhoods and increase visibility.Besides during theimplementation of slum upgrading programmes, not all key stakeholders are awareor involved in the process. This can lead to institutional and communityblockages in cross-sector activities or to the initial target group not fullybenefiting from the action, and if implemented with external experts, the lackof replication and institutional memory.The design andimplementation of slum upgrading activities shall be carried by allstakeholders with their different roles. It shall create job opportunities forthe target group and be enriched through their local knowledge. By having thecross-sector approach, actions and improvements shall multiply their impactthrough feeding into each other. The high visibility and improved capacityshall lead to an up-scaling and replication of activities finding itsreflection in national priorities, budgets and policies beyond this action.In order to achieve thethree major operational objectives in an efficient way, UN-Habitat emphasisesthe importance of a coherent advocacy strategy. This can be strengthened by anenforced tripartite partnership between the European Commission and theEuropean Union Delegations, the ACP Secretariat and UN-Habitat, as well asgovernment (line ministries and finance and planning ministries) to prioritiseand budget for urban development needs and slum upgrading.The PSUP is carried out at local, nationaland regional levels.

Emerging from the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches for their tenure security.An extensive gap analysis was conducted which drew several important conclusions. First, while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and large-scale land tools. Second, a conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to deliver their expectedresults: existing technical solutions are too expensive, inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries, unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in countrycannot be done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination, strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives and continuous dialogues and communicationsbetween and amongst key stakeholders including government (at various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves.To address these challenges, UN-HABITAT has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of the Global Land Tool Network (now with 45 international partners) aimed at contributing to poverty reduction and to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor since its launch in 2006.GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender sensitive and largescale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the recognition of the need for a ‘continuum of land rights’ to replace the more conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global discourse on key GLTN’s tools and approaches are well captured by various global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and possible adoption by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Good Governance on Tenure of Land and Natural Resources and recently, wherein UN-HABITAT has played a critical role, the adoption of the African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by recently concluded Third AMCHUD conference and Bamako Action Plan.Moreover, Phase 1 has already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for rolling out with partners at national and local government levels. Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and implement the same on their countrylevelprojects in various countries.

To address the lack of information amongst planners and decision makers on the key mobility challenges confronting their cities, the project will develop, field-test and disseminate a \"RapidAssessment Tool\". Quick-Impact field projects will be implemented in 3-4 target cities. These will highlight how simple but innovative intervention such as design of selected streets as shared spaces that fulfill space and linking functions can improve mobility outcome for citizens and businesses. Based on the Project and previous work done by the Urban Basic Services Branch, collaboration will also be sought with the International Financial Institutions, with a view to supporting target cities in securing financing for medium and long-term mobility investments.To achieve and maintain sustainable patterns of mobility, cities require to put in placeappropriate regulatory and institutional arrangements. While \"ideal\" and \"comprehensive\" arrangements can take a long time to be established, incremental and quick - impact solutions can again be fruitful - for example a simple GIS based fleet database can make public bus services more efficient in many cities. Based on the results of the Rapid Assessment as mentioned above and through dialogue at the city and national level, this project will support two to three target cities in incrementally adopting a set of new institutional or regulatory arrangements that provide quick and visible benefits to citizens and businesses.The project will benefit all city dwellers, particularly the poor. The commuting public,businesses of all sizes, transport service providers and freight and goods delivery services are amongst the main beneficiary groups who will benefit irom improvements in urban mobility. City dwellers as a whole will indirectly benefit irom improved air quality. Through the use of the Rapid Assessment tool, the project will focus on the mobility challenges faced by women, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.Local Governments of the respective target cities viz Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,Kathmandu, Nepal, Kigali, Rwanda and Vientiane, Lao PDR will be the key partners. The Rapid Assessment tool will be developed through collaboration with a leading international organisation working in the area of urban Mobility. Three potential partners viz. Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), EMBARQ (The World Resources Institute for sustainable Transport) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) have already expressed interest against a call issued by UN-Habitat for this work.

The project will pay particular attention to theplanning of urban expansions, and mechanisms for guiding land occupationtowards more orderly patterns, with higher densities and better proportionsbetween built-up and street space and wider landscape connectivity andecosystem functionality. The project will aim at filling several gaps at the normative andoperational levels, namely gaps in policy development and analysis, comparativebenchmarking, availability of good practices, capacity within national andlocal actors, as well as institutionalized mechanisms for peer learning andother forms of capacity building. The project strategy isdeveloped at 3 levels: At global level it will develop tools and     guidance to support local action, reform and learning, including awareness     materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good     practices. At national level, it will work on national urban     policies as well as to analyze planning frameworks as a way to identify     opportunities for introducing innovations and engage in reform processes,     and will work with key stakeholders for capacity building and awareness. At city level, it will develop pilot activities     for implementation of planning initiatives and provide expertise on key     urban planning issues to local governments and other stakeholders groups. A loop of feedback to gatherlessons learnt and develops policy inputs will also be nurtured from local toglobal level.');

This will be made in order to:To improve the capacity of the water sector and town level institutions – Ministry of Water organizations, PMU, TPT and MSF, to carry their mandates and responsibilities in support of providing quality water, sanitation and hygiene promotion services. To improve the capacity of the water utilities to provide quality and sanitation services through quality management and governance. To improve the performance of the water service providers for enhanced quality, reliability and level of water and sanitation services delivery. To improve the performance, accountability and transparency in the target towns, through empowering town level institutions, as watchdogs and advocates for equitable and sustainable services delivery. To enhance integrated approach to water and sanitation services through support to capacity building to solid waste management, urban planning, urban catchment management, local economic development and promotion of public, and HH hygiene and sanitation.The Training and Capacity Building Programme will target institutional and human resources capacities at the regional, national and town levels in each of the 5 participating countries. At the national level, capacity building will focus on the Programme Management Units (PMUs) within the Implementing Agencies (IAs). At the town level, the focus will be on the Town Project Teams (TPTs), the Multi-Stake-Holder Forums (MSFs), the service providers and Community-Based Organizations.The institutional framework for programme management and service delivery is unique to each of the five participating countries. Each country is also undergoing a water sector reform programme which is at various stages of implementation. The design and implementation of the TCB programme will be tailor made to suit the situational context in each country. The Implementing Agencyof the Programme in Uganda is the Directorate of Water Development (DWD) in the Ministry of Water and Environment, in Burundi; is Régie de Production et de Distribution de l\'Eau et de l\'Electricité (REGIDESO), which falls under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (Ministere de l\'Energie et des Mines). REGIDESO is a public utility with autonomous legal and financial status and is responsible for service provision in urban areas.

We have learned through Phases I and II of CCCI that, while primarily concerned about adapting to climate change and building resilience, many local stakeholders also demand the right to be part of the global solution by reducing GHG emissions. This is in part because addressing climate change begins by sensitising local stakeholders about the causes as well as the effects of climate change; this awareness-raising naturally leads to consideration not only of adaptation but also of mitigation actions.Beneficiaries will consist primarily of the residents of cities participating in CCCI, with a focus on the poor living in informal settlements. Adaptation strategies and action plans shall target those vulnerable groups. Mitigation actions will have a broader, more diffuse set of local and global beneficiaries. Regarding partners, UN-Habitat will continue to try to engage with organisations who are already actively engaged, either technically and/or politically, in the issue of cities and climate change. This approach will help us to work for policy change in coordination with others, as well as to build institutional (as opposed to merely individual) capacity.

Provide access to clean water to institutions, clinic, markets and the general population in the selected four towns. 2. Strengthen the role of the County Governments in the delivery of water and sanitation services; 3. Build the capacity of the caretakers/ operators of the installed water supply systems for effective technical and financial management of the systems; 4. Create awareness among the community members to support operation and maintenance (sustainability) through payments of suggested guideline tariffs, as well as proper hygiene practices using the water. 5. Promote the safe disposal of human faecal waste and proper management of solid waste in the towns.The total population for all the four towns is estimated at 105,000 people with approximately 50% being female. Majority the beneficiaries of the project are the large numbers of women and children that are forced to fetch often polluted water from the seasonal rivers. A small number of these are government officials and soldiers. The ratio of IDPs and returnees has been in the range of between 10% and 30% for the different towns.Based on the information obtained from local authorities and drawing reference to the national population census carried out in Sudan in 2008, the number of people living in the selected towns could be in the range of 25% to 30% of the population of the entire county. A staggering 47% to over 52% of this population is aged 16 years and below, which implies that the water project serves to protect a large number of a key vulnerable age group, of largely children.The target areas are also home to a transient but ‘permanent\' population of traders from the neighboring countries, comprising (northern) Sudanese, Eritreans, Ethiopians, Kenyans and Ugandans. Some of these nationalities provide important services such as trade and construction services, as the towns benefit from construction financed by money returning from the Government, South Sudanese diaspora, international agencies and other types of investors.Possible partners internal and externalThe groups of stakeholders involved included the following:-UNMISS and UN-Habitat – the main convenors of the groups for discussions;-UNHCR involved in assistance and settlement of returnees and IDPs;- PACT South Sudan involved in the development of water sources and capacity building;-County Commissioners, Deputies, and Executive Officers in the four towns visited, namely, Pibor, Akobo, Yirol and Turalei;-Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation Directors and Deputies at State and County Levels;-Town Level community and youth coordinators;-WASH Cluster members at State level, including ACFUN-Habitat is providing knowledge services');

Amidst armed conflict, UN-Habitat has continued to serve the people of Afghanistan without interruption for the past 20 years. One of the major fall outs for the armed-conflict is the erosion of community institutions. The conflict has increased the share of the number of people living in deprivation and has also eroded the social fabric people used to rely on during crisis. Even during the difficult period of Taliban rule, the community development approach flourished in spite of tremendous odds. The institutional manifestation of this approach was the Community Forum (CF) and CDCs that participating communities formed themselves. In many ways, the CF/CDCs became the institutional platform for local people to exercise their right and responsibilities, and at the same time embrace good governance when there was not legitimate government.The UN-Habitat\'s community empowerment approach that emerged in the course of more than a decade of working with Afghan communities builds on this same spirit. The approach has now become a flagship programme of the Government National Solidarity Programme.

It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). The specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: i. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; ii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and iii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.The overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. As requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. While the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan\'s Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:ii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfieldiii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency\'s core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. iv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)[1] Prepared by Africa 70 (2007), under EU and Italian Cooperation co-funded Project “Rehabilitation and Improvement of the Hargeisa Water Supply System” (Contract No.: SO/0030/IT-COF/02)');

Initiatives focused in these areas comprise the underlying purpose of I-PSM Phase II. The programme seeks to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework and processes of national and local governance to enhance service delivery. Particular focus will ensure that sector service delivery efforts and corresponding human rights are universal where they can be (health, education and water supply and sanitation) and targeted to the poorest of the poor wherever possible. The programme adopts participatory approaches and aims to re-train and restructure ministries and governorate offices, Iraqi citizens will have a clear understanding of the structures and processes in government, its decision-making, and how they can participate in these processes. I-PSM Phase II responds to the findings, lessons learned and recommendations of Phase I. The programme is designed with a holistic approach to governance reforms, capacity development and sector modernisation.The proposed intervention addresses the need of carrying out a long term, comprehensive and whole of government reforms at national and sub national levels focused on improving service delivery to the citizens in the three sectors of education, health and WATSAN. In Phase I (2010-2012), functional reviews of these sectors were carried out jointly by the concerned Ministries of GoI and UN agencies. UN agencies provided technical assistance in preparing the road map and costed service delivery models of the three sectors. Phase II will support the GoI in implementing the roadmaps prepared in Phase I. Besides the reform initiatives planned for the whole of the government in Iraq, KRG has agreed to undertake a comprehensive civil service reforms for the Region.The Programme has four themes: i) Developing institutional arrangements and the distribution of roles, authority and decision-making mechanisms; ii) Piloting reform in three key sectors: health; education; and water and sanitation (WATSAN), focusing on (1) modern  institutional arrangements (with requisite laws, legislations, regulations and plans, policies and strategies( (2) Public Private Partnership (3) Cost-effective fiscal management and (4) Modern human resources management methods; iii) Supporting system-wide reform for gender mainstreaming, e-governance, national statistics and development management; and iv) Supporting decentralised service delivery and local governance initiatives, particularly focusing on development of tools for social participation.UN-Habitat\'s expertise and background in service delivery, particularly in the field of water and sanitation, its ongoing relationship with the MMPW, and its knowledge of effective modes of decentralization are key reasons for UN-Habitat\'s participation in the overall programme.  UN-Habitat will focus on programme outputs relating to assisting the GoI in developing reform and modernization plans for the Water and Sanitation Sector, as well as improving decentralized service delivery in target sectors – with enhanced local governance and participation.  UN-Habitat in partnership with UNICEF will support reforms to water and sanitation sector through implementation of sector specific modernisation plans and capacity development programmes, as per the agreed roadmaps of I-PSM Phase I by the relevant line ministries, and in the KRG (upstream and downstream reform). This intervention aims directly at improving service quality through development of service delivery models, developing operational arrangements for utility, focusing on rationalized use and use practices as well as developing a medium-term fiscal framework to be a link between the policy making process, priorities and budget. Furthermore, UN-Habitat in partnership with the other UN agencies will provide support to strengthen the local governance institutions at the provincial and city-level, promote participatory processes, improve urban governance and support decentralised service delivery, including fiscal decentralisation (downstream reform). UN-Habitat\'s focus will be studying the options of urban local governance including providing recommended options as well as enhancing the GoI\'s capacities to support public sector modernization at provincial/local levels.');

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. The project will address three aspects:i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa” which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services. Many conventional products an');

UNFPA has also provided GSO with support for capacity building to GSO\'s statisticians to conducting the national-wide 2009 Census on Population and Housing, and conducted the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) in close cooperation with United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF).In the period 2012 - 2016, UNFPA will continue to provide technical support in the production and dissemination of quality population data that will be used for policy researches and studies, planning, monitoring and evaluation of social and population strategies mainly at the national and regional levels, as well as assessing the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) committed to by the Government of Viet Nam. Almost all of technical support to date primarily focuses on population variables and the socio-economic sector in general. As the result, there is still a lack of statistical data and information that are in great need for urban development planning and long-term city socio-economic development strategies (CDS). UNFPA is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect.With its rich experience in providing support for countries on population and development, UNFPA is an important partner providing technical assistance to MPI (through GSO) in producing and disseminating population statistics information and data for evidence based policy development and monitoring of the implementation of socio-economic development plans.Engaging in this project, UNFPA can provide statisticians and selected officers of MPI and government agencies at different levels with technical support to build capacity and skills in producing and publishing data of national surveys as well as studies on specific emerging issues, sharing international experience, analyzing policies, improving capacity in monitoring policy implementation towards the implementation of Plan of Actions of International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and MDGs.UNFPA\'s comparative advantages are compatible with the action plans of GSO implementing VSDS 2011-2020; integrating population dynamics into development planning, and study on impact of the relationship between population and development to provide evidence for the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2011-2020 at national and local levels. In the years to come, UNFPA plans to continue providing technical support for integrating population variables into socio-economic development plans. With the profession in various areas of statistical work, including the training programmes for statisticians at different levels, UNFPA have and continue making a significant contribution to strengthening the statistical system for population variables. It would also benefit UN-Habitat for strengthening urban statistical data and information through making use of the established system and more skillful human resources through working in partnership with UNFPA for the project on “Support for the implementation of the Vietnam Statistical Development Strategy in the period 2011-2020 It will be therefore strategic to provide MPI through GSO with technical support in coordination with UNFPA as it would basically enable UN-Habitat to make best use of the cadre of statisticians who have been and being trained by UNFPA under the 5-year project jointly supported by UN-Habitat and UNFPA, and the statistical systems already set up and operating for several years.

So far, implementation of the DDPD has been slower and less complete than envisaged, placing strain on the mechanisms of the agreement. For example, the absence of local social services despite best efforts continues to be a challenge and is increasing frustrations. Even so, the framework created by the DDP provides a unique window of opportunity to engage in ‘business unusual\'.Efforts have been made to settle conflicts arising from transhumance routes. In 1989 in North Darfur the governor together with local councils and the Native Administration reached an agreement on the rules governing transhumance routes. The North Darfur State Transhumance Act in 1991 enshrined these principles. The Act has been followed by many conferences and workshops, but has remained ineffective due to inadequate involvement by the pastorals and farmers, and the weakness of the Native Administration. A national high committee on transhumance was established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in 1997 to prepare a comprehensive study of livestock corridors, where a Livestock Corridors Act was promulgated by the governor in 1998. The Act defines livestock routes, different categories of pasture and water points, lists activities not allowed on stock routes including farming, burning, cutting of trees, building and harvesting of fodder, and fixes penalties. A conflict resolution committee is created with membership from the administration including the police, and the native administration. There are no herder or farmer representatives. The general opinion is that the lack of real contact with the grass roots makes this committee ineffective. Transhumance routes remain a key issue for the project. Useful lessons learned through implementation of Sudan Peace Building and Development Project SPDP have been taken into consideration when designing this Project Proposal, which aims to make contributions towards the following areas:Better management of natural resources, within and between local communities, and between communities and the stateLegal and policy reform, to clarify the formal framework within which rural land uses take place and conflicts are settled;Institutional reform for improved natural resource management, including support to creation of an effective local administration which incorporates elements of the customary system reflected by the Native Administration, and capacity building in both government and civil society;More comprehensive natural resource management strategies and plans, which recognize the important economic role played by pastorals without neglecting farming and adopt planning concepts and approaches relevant to and supportive of pastoral livelihoods;Strengthened and more democratic representative bodies for pastorals and farmers, so that their interests are better defended in public debate and decision-makingLocal pastoral and farming communities in Greater Darfur, especially those affected and are currently exposed to conflicts, who are often among the poorest. Pastoral women and youth will be special target in their roles as initiators and moderators of conflict. Children, who are often among the main victims of conflict, and the youth who are mostly unemployed and becoming increasingly involved in livestock rustling and banditry as alternative livelihoods, will be key beneficiaries. The total number of direct beneficiaries is estimated at 1000 families\' people, the majority of whom (more than 60%) are children and women and youth. Indirect beneficiaries in the three-targeted areas is approximately 30,000 people , Government sector officers at State and local level and Key stakeholder along the route identified in the three states including community leaders, CBOs, CSOs, civic unions (farmers and Pastoralists Unions)');

According to statistics of IOM from October 2012, the number of returnees between October 2010 and October 2012 in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria was 197,027 with continued new arrivals every day. A fast horizontal sprawling of state capitals and major towns is observed, with low income groups settling in urban and peri-urban areas and provoking slum formation. The debate in South Sudan is whether it is better for the returnees to go back to their original villages where they can access land for agriculture, or to settle in urban areas where they can access basic services and job opportunities. Although it is understood that returnees should make their choice freely, humanitarian organisations should not forget the high social cost of recent mass evictions and demolition campaigns in informal urban areas nor underestimate the critical importance of designing long term spatial development mechanisms and capacities in the short term to prevent potential conflict and to contribute to peace stabilisation. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed to ensure a more sustainable returnee reintegration process and prevent slum formation through application of provision of adequate housing conditions and basic services, establishment of livelihood options for returnees and equitable and planned land allocation. It is suggested to start working in the states with high numbers of returnees to build basic institutional capacities through on-the-job training and implementation of demonstration activities. While targeted direct beneficiaries of this project are returnees and host communities, the main project counterparts of UN-Habitat will be the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP) of the government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the Ministries of Physical Infrastructure (MoPIs) of the three targeted states.Through this initiative UN-Habitat will provide adequate housing conditions and basic community infrastructure through participatory approach and on-the-job institutional capacity building, set an example and develop strategies for national housing delivery and urban planning for replication and scaling up and promote the use of low-cost and environmental-friendly construction techniques which can also sustain livelihoods and support urban and regional planning and land management. This will be done in close coordination with GoSS as well as other UN agencies and international bi/multilateral partners working on return and reintegration issues.Although construction of permanent housing, support to sustainable livelihood and planning are often considered to be development activities, in context of South Sudan, where thousands have already returned and need support to settle and re-integrate in existing urban areas, quickly for sake of human security and prevention of new conflicts in this still very vulnerable country which has its internal issues with negative potentials, this project has a clear emergency character. The project is designed for a quick and measurable impact: provide houses, support livelihoods and reintegration within host communities in a planned manner. Planning and capacity building of government authorities is included through a form of on-the-job trainings which would create conditions for construction and reintegration in planned settlements and lay the foundation and an example for continued reintegration process.');

Further, standalone activities at local level cannot bring in changes in polices and systems and there is a need for evidence based information for decision making to bring in changes in policies, procedures and systems.

While reasonably effective for specific threats, this approach is largely palliative, i.e. defining risk, and retro-fitting remedial measures to reduce it. However, there is no means to test the efficacy of these remedial efforts until another disaster occurs that meets or exceeds the original design limits.Many urban risk reduction initiatives address specific hazards. These are usually well-known (or at least well-publicized), and more recently since the ‘climate change agenda\' has become a global, well-funded, and extremely well-articulated agenda including city strategies to cope with a range of climate-driven threats and mitigating their impact on the global climate. However, approaches often ignore other hazards including the largest killers such as earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as automobile accidents, fires and industrial or technological disasters, and social and political crisis.The closest approximation of a tool for building resilience is the UN-ISDR\'s 10 point checklist associated with their Making Cities Resilient (MCR) global Campaign. However, recent testing of this framework reveals its primary weaknesses which derive from a framework of principles that are self-assessed by local governments, and self-driven with no clear standards that planners, engineers, architects, economists, and other experts who manage cities can target and use. The results are qualitative in nature, and while clearly a good foundation for advocating the resilience agenda globally, will demand further strategies and tools to ensure cities actually do become measurably more resilient.While some developments focusing on multi-hazard approaches, such as the one above, are emerging, to date there is no system for defining forward-looking, integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder urban systems approach to planning and developing urban settlements capacity to withstand and recover from crisis, i.e. achieving measurable resilience.The URIP fills a significant sustainable development planning and implementation gap at a time when cities are assuming ever-increasing local, regional, national and global socio-economic significance.');

The documented experiences and lessons learned will include recommendations for more sustainable urban development financing systems which give specific attention to improved service delivery and in-situ community based settlement upgrading. Given the coastal location of NCD, special attention will be paid to identify its vulnerability to potential Climate Change Impacts when developing its CSUAPs and CIIP.In the process, the capacity of NCDC and Goroka City as well as OoU and other implementing partner staff, national and city institutional frameworks and coordination mechanisms for urban planning, serviced land management adn shelter delivery will be strengthened through application of an intensive and continous in-service \"learning-by-doing\" capacity-building programme, so they can better support the creation of more inclusive, participative, productive, livable and sustainable human settlements development. Similarly, implementation of the national urbanisation policy and legislative framework will be strengthened as proposal implementation is documented, lessons synthesized and shared for structured city, national (through the Economic Ministerial Committee) and Pacific regional stakeholder dialogues, resulting in inclusion of settlement upgrading policies.As a result, proposal implementation is expected to help the OoU, NCDC and Goroka City to adapt the Cities Alliance \"Cities without Slums\" methodology, global experience and good practices to the PNG contect through its support to settlement upgrading in the selected priority Taurama Valley and June Valley of Port Moresby and Faniufa (Goroka) settlements to set the foundations for subsequent efforts to up-scale the lessons learned city-wide, nationally to other cities, as well as mainstream them in the NUP and legislative reforms. The long term outcome is expected to be the more sustained provision of serviced and affordable shelter for urban poor dwellers, and thus contribute significantly to the PNG Government\'s efforts to achieve its MDG targets, especially MDG 7/11, as well as those of water and sanitation 7/10. As these experiences are progressively intergrated into PNG\'s National Sustainability Development Planning process, the proposal will progressively support PNG to implement its commitments under the Pacific Urban Agenda and especially Initiative 13.5 of the Pacific Plan.The lessons learned and documented good practice from this proposal will also enrich the NUP, including national debates and dialogues on the importancce of urbanisation through the Economic Ministers Committee.');

The NSP aims to empower Afghans to build solidarity, reduce poverty through establishing and strengthening a national network of self-governing community institutions. The flexible and responsive design of the NSP has allowed it to be a main conduit of central government\'s poverty reduction and reconstruction policies, enabling local people to actively participate in local governance and development through the formation of CDCs. As a result, rural people of Afghanistan are able to build on a shared vision, and values, and democratically-decided priorities to create a healthy and sustainable nation. NSP fosters public trust in governance, enhances unity, equity and justice with communities democratically electing their own councils to engage in important local decisions and deciding how to distribute resources to address their development priorities. The concept of the NSP is based on the provision of block grants directly provided by the government to communities for rural infrastructure projects. Each community elects their representatives to form the CDC, the main decision-making body at the local level. In order to avoid a situation where candidates get threatened or run for the competition out of fear of local power holders, the elections follow a “no-candidate” rule. They would be valid only if at least 60% of the community members participate in elections, thus requiring the participation of women. The CDC is the main interlocutor of the government and other development actors. It designates members who are responsible for financial management, including opening of a bank account in the name of the community. In addition, the CDC can establish specific sub-committees responsible for procurement, implementation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation.The NSP consists of four core elements:· Facilitation at the community level to assist communities to further strengthen inclusive CDCs through secret ballot and democratic (re)elections; reach consensus on priorities and corresponding subproject activities; develop eligible subproject proposals that comply with NSP appraisal criteria; and implement approved subprojects;· Building capacity of CDCs and community members (both men and women) in participation, consensus-building, accounting, procurement and contract management, operations and maintenance, and monitoring;· Providing direct block grant transfers to fund approved subprojects; and· Linking CDCs to government agencies, NGOs, and donors to improve access to services and resources.Target Groups: The primary beneficiaries are the villagers (both men and women), including the poor and the vulnerable groups, who through a participatory planning process, select sub-projects that addresses their needs for local reconstruction and development. Empowerment of rural population is achieved through participatory planning, local reconstruction and development leading to improved livelihoods and access to services benefiting both men and women.Based on the principles of inclusion and equity, NSP ensures inclusion of women and vulnerable groups (such as ethnic/tribal minority groups, elderly, IDPs, returnees, refugees) to ensure that these groups are included in decision-making processes and that their concerns are fully addressed.A total of 956 communities of twelve districts in seven provinces, as given in Table below, will benefit from empowerment through participating in CDC activities and access to improved infrastructure and services.

It specifically addresses the current disconnection between stateand non-state actors, and seeks to build collaboration and complementarityaround agreed priorities and promote support for them at the national andglobal levels. The project focuses on strengthened partnerships in identifying,formulating and promoting sustainable urbanization with the identifiedcomponents as pillars for programme implementation.The participants – HAPs and selected officers of national governments benefit directly by participating in all planned expert group meetings, validation workshops, policy dialogues and training sessions. They will contribute directly to the priority identification and formulation of strategies. They will benefit from the networking and exchanges of experiences, all backstopped by UN-Habitat expertise at the headquarters and at country level. They will be equipped with knowledge of current challenges of urbanization and what their roles are in addressing them.Currently, HAPs are disjointed and dissatisfied with programmes of governments in urban planning. They are also displeased that UN-Habitat policies concerning them have not been systematic and coordination has been inadequate. The project provides an opportunity to strengthen the position of HAPs in their countries with technical support from UN-Habitat. It also offers UN-Habitat the opportunity to streamline its engagement with its partners especially as Habitat III.Therepresentatives of HAPs would be trained and involved in validating thepriorities through their participation in supporting the preparation of thenational reports on Habitat III, validate research findings at sub-regional level,and further equipped with conceptual skills required to promote the new visionof UN-Habitat as it strengthens the New African Urban Agenda. They will in turnbe more effective actors at their neighborhood, and influence policies at thelocal and national levels in partnership with their municipalities and nationalgovernments. This project aims to build an understanding between non-state actors and national governments, thereby building an African consensus with a strong momentum of support for a continent-wide urban agenda for the next 20 years. The project will build collaboration and complementarity between state and non-state actors through inclusive and participatory preparation for the post 2015 agenda and national reports for Habitat III.The proposed solutions are the most appropriate ways of raising a critical awareness which is required to drive the Urban Agenda. CSOs often fail to make the connections between felt problems/disasters and lack systemic planning of the human settlement they live in. They further fail to appreciate the impact of certain types of policies on physical planning issues. This project seeks to build a strong balance for the urbanization tripod - of Government, CSOs including academia, and the private sector. The solutions are aimed at consensus building, thereby removing the mutual suspicion between state and non-state actors.The partners include UN agencies working in the African region, African Union and related institutions, private sector operators and national governments.

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. The project will address three aspects:i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa” which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services. Many conventional products an');

The criticalrequirement is to revitalize local assets, engage with local stakeholders,harness and deploy resources and potentialities among communities andneighborhoods. Urban planning and spatial design will be brought forward with aparticular attention to the needs of the urban poor, a population that willpredictably be rising in Africa in the coming years.

SOLUTIONS will achieve this, by using a four-step approach[TS1], which also mirrors the work package structure of the project. An initial transferability assessment of research and technology and innovation supported in past or on-going EU funded collaborative research and cooperation projects will summarize the existing knowledge on state of art innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions and experience with their transferability to different local and regional contexts. This will be complemented by experience and solutions (technologies and best practices in each context) from leading cities from Europe, China and Latin America and from Singapore. The first set of agreed guidelines for transferability will be a key input to the knowledge sharing and capacity building platform, which will be the second step towards the promotion of take-up of sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions. These two steps will have cross-links with the global dialogue and will provide the opportunity to work with cities that are capable and motivated to take the next step towards implementation: the needs assessment and the feasibility studies for Asian and Latin American cities or the needs assessment and development of recommendations for the Mediterranean. The experiences from these cities will then feed back into transferability (technology, practices) guidelines, which will later provide a comprehensive “handbook” of experience with selected innovative sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions around the world. The results that will be obtained will be promoted widely in the partner regions and globally to accelerate the deployment of innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions in cities in Europe and around the world.While SOLUTIONS will build strongly on previous and on-going projects and coordination initiatives, as is the nature of a coordinating action, it also aims to provide added value that goes beyond summarising and facilitating knowledge sharing and research and technology transfer. SOLUTIONS aims to bridge the “implementation gap” between the potentials of innovative sustainable mobility and transport solutions and packages of solutions and the actual level of uptake and quality of the deployment and implementation mechanisms.Through its outlined objectives, the SOLUTIONS project will specifically address the problem of a lack of broad regional up-take of innovative urban mobility solutions which have been successful particularly in Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. The core target group for the SOLUTIONS project are cities, for which the project has three categories to support the take-up of sustainable urban mobility solutions:Leading CitiesLeading Cities from Europe, China, Latin America, and Singapore, can share their expertise in the development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility solutions. They will also benefit from the mutual learning process and the knowledge sharing with other cities in the world.Take-up CitiesThe feasibility studies developed in WP3 will be a concrete step toward implementation of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions in Asia and Latin America and provides showcases for other cities around the world.Learning CitiesThe trainings offered in WP2 and the transferability guidelines will provide active support for cities to implement sustainable urban mobility solutions and the knowledge sharing and dialogue will inform the identification of future research needs.The regions addressed in this project present different levels of maturity in terms of experience with sustainable urban mobility related actions.Four SOLUTIONS regions with different approaches:Europe: Leading Cities in development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility Asia: Regions of particular interest: electromobility, public t');

WOPs are based on the observation that capacity building and retention, facilitated by networking and mentoring, can equip operators to meet the challenges facing the sector. It also draws on the fact that much of the innovation and expertise to address water operators\' challenges reside with operators themselves, and that a growing number of these successful operators are highly motivated to share their expertise and innovation with others as â€œmentorsâ€ on a not-for-profit basis. The Boosting Effectiveness in WOPs (BEWOP) project aims to address a potential shortcoming of the WOPs approach: while operators are uniquely placed to share their practical experience and technical expertise with their peers, they are rarely experienced in managing a capacity development process.The goal of BEWOPs is to limit the potential shortcoming of the approach by strengthening knowledge transfer and change processes in WOPs, in order to maximize the possibility for these partnerships to lead to operational improvements.Over the next five years, GWOPA and IHE will work in the development, dissemination and application of resources conducive to more effective knowledge transfer and management in WOPs.

Detailed objectives related to the project expected accomplishments are:· To share experiences and methodologies with regard to cities in SIDS facing climate change and land use constraints, land governance or land degradation.· To strengthen partnerships between SIDS at national and city levels. · To discuss the rationale and contents of a possible sustainable urbanization goal that could be considered for inclusion in the ‘Post-2015 UN Development Agenda\' as part of the post-Rio+20 ‘Sustainable Development Goals\'.· To sensitize SIDS countries on the SIDS Conference in Samoa in 2014 and the Habitat III Conference in 2016, in order that national and regional preparations can be undertaken and a common position can be discussed vis-à-vis the sustainability of cities in small islands environments.The project also contributes towards several common global development objectives, facilitating relevant internal and external partnerships. AusAID, the main development partner of this project, has related strategic goals directly, to be addressed by this project:· Sustainable Economic Development: reducing the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors through improved awareness of sustainable urbanisation, planning, land use to mitigate climate change and adapt to rising sea levels and changing climatic conditions· Effective Governance: The Ministerial conference will seek to improve urban, and in particular land governance to deliver better services, improve security and enhance justice and human rights through sensitisation of key issues and ministerial commitment in the conference declaration.· Humanitarian and disaster response: more effective preparedness to disasters and crises in SIDS countries through improves strategies and systems for disaster mitigation and prevention as part of improved urban planning and land management approaches. In order to reach SIDS countries in an effective way, strategic related external partners (other than the requesting partner) have been invited, such as the CARICOM and the Pacific Forum Secretariat, who shall work together with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (HAP lead). For the technical support, universities will participate and support knowledge identification and management: University of South Pacific, University of West Indies and Griffith University, Australia. They shall be the lead organizations in monitoring follow-up after the project implementation. Other Universities may join in this role upon later confirmation. It is also expected that other Society sectors such as SIDS networks and NGOs are invited to participate and contribute to the project, such as SIDSnet, PacificSIDS, Blue Space Caribbean.Other UN agencies have an important role as external partners, particularly the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs SIDS Unit, UNDP and UNEP. The United Nations has been assisting and extending cooperation to SIDS in their sustainable development efforts through the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States finalized at the Global Conference held in Barbados in 1994, known also as the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA). This programme was reviewed and revamped at the five-year review held at the Twenty-second special session of the General Assembly in 1999, and the ten-year review held in Mauritius (10-14 January 2005). The latter outcome is known as the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (MSI). The UN-OHRLLS mandate from the General Assembly calls upon the Office to engage in advocacy and mobilization of international support and resources for the implementation of the Programme of Action for SIDS. During the Rio + 20 Conference, concern was raised upon the 5-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation (MSI+5) concluding that “SIDS have made less progress than most other groupings, or even regressed, in economic terms, especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability. Sea-level rise and other adverse impacts of climate change continue to pose a significant risk to SIDS and their efforts to achieve sustainable development and for many represent the gravest of threats to their survival and viability, including for some through the loss of territory[1]”. As a result, the need for enhanced and continued support from the UN System was stressed and the assembling of the Third International Conference on SIDS in 2014 was recommended.

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.');

In addition, a results oriented preparation and implementationof the conference ensure that conclusions are drawn from the conference andoutcomes shared by all participants as well as brought to higher instances ofdecision making.Inparticular the seventh session of the world urban forum will act as animportant “substantive input gathering” opportunity to successively feed theon-going Post 2015 Development Agenda process as well as the Habitat IIIpreparation. UN-Habitatwill ensure that all thematic priority areas of its work are mainstreamed inthe main debates in order to put its knowledge base as well as its technicaland high level policy advisor, at the disposal of all participants and at thesame time feedbacks are collected for successive consolidation. Theactive involvement and participation of all constituencies from the preparationto the implementation including the phase of outcomes gathering, will be keyfor the success of the project which seeks the central involvement of memberstates of the governing body of UN-Habitat and more importantly the WUF7 hostcountry. The city of Medellin will also play a key rolenot only to ensure an effective preparation of the conference but also as aliving urban laboratory open to participants, where several strategies and urbantools are being implemented, and a clear model of sustainable urban developmentis shown to the world. To this aim several physical and non-physicalinterventions will be implemented in order to leave a tangible legacy to thehost city and its citizens.');

C\'est pourquoi cette intervention vise spécifiquement à :-	Améliorer les conditions de vie, réduire la vulnérabilité, et préserver la dignité des personnes et communautés affectées par les crises ;-	Restaurer les moyens de subsistance et renforcer la résilience des communautés affectées par la crise et faciliter le retour et la réintégration durable des populations déplacées et refugiées. Dans le cadre de ce projet, les bénéficiaires sont au nombre de 40 886 personnes dont 40 % d\'hommes,  30 % de femmes, 15 % de Garçons et 15 % de filles (déplacés, retournés, rapatriés et populations locales) dont 16356 hommes, 12264 femmes, 6134 garçon et 6132 filles. Les personnes cibles sont les  leaders des communautés, les femmes, les chefs coutumiers, les autorités politico administratives et coutumières, Les OPJ de la PNC et des FARDC, les animateurs des structures locales telles que CLPC, NRCF, FPJ, Barza inter communautaires, les regroupements des femmes, les agents de la brigade foncière. Les déplacés, les rapatriés, les retournés  sont une catégorie des personnes qui sont en premier lieu victimes des violations des droits d\'accès à la terre. Cette catégorie des personnes nous fournira les données  liées à la problématique d\'accès à la terre. Les leaders des communautés sont à la fois les détenteurs d\'enjeux dans les deux axes où les activités du projet seront exécutées. Les autorités coutumières sont membres de 2 comités des sages dans les 2 axes d\'intervention, qui contribuent à la résolution des conflits fonciers  autour des CLPC et d\'autres structures locales de résolution des conflits à la base. Parfois certains des chefs coutumiers sont des parties prenantes dans les conflits fonciers qui divisent les individus et les communautés ethniques dans leurs entités mais aussi, elles sont impliquées dans la résolution des conflits fonciers.Les autorités politico administratives sont l\'administrateur du Territoire et les chefs de postes d\'encadrement administratif ainsi que les services de sécurité (PNC, FARDC, ANR) qui représentent les pouvoirs publics, avec pour mandat  la protection des personnes et de leurs biens. Les femmes sont une catégorie vulnérable, victime de toutes les formes de discrimination en ce qui concerne leurs droits d\'accès à la terre.  Les animateurs des structures locales sont les partenaires qui vont faciliter la mise en œuvre et pérenniser les activités  de prévention et de résolution des conflits fonciers  dans les zones de déplacement  et de retour en Territoire de Masisi. La somme des contributions de tous ces acteurs ci-haut cités facilitera la mise en œuvre de ce projet.Cette intervention doit contribuer à l\'institutionnalisation de la médiation foncière comme un outil efficace de prévention et de résolution des conflits fonciers, plus accessible aux vulnérables et aux communautés (moindre cout, propice à renforcer la cohésion sociale.  Elle jette aussi les bases pour les activités : développement de l\'agriculture, construction des abris, retour des personnes déplacées et la diminution des risques d\'enrôlement des jeunes dans les groupes armés. Dans le moyen terme, le projet va contribuer à une autonomisation des structures de gestion des conflits fonciers au niveau local à travers des activités permanentes de renforcement des capacités et de responsabilisation. Les médiateurs fonciers vont en permanence encadrer les acteurs à la base et transmettre les outils et les approches en matière de gestion des conflits fonciers. Un guide sur la médiation foncière qui vient d\'être développé sera mis à la disposition des structures locales avec le curriculum approprié. Dans le cadre du groupe de coordination des acteurs du fonciers du Nord Kivu déjà existant, une cadre de coopération sera promu entre les acteurs de base et le gouvernement provincial afin de susciter  l\'adhésion des autorités politiques à la gestion des conflits fonciers.  Cette démarche obéit aussi à une logique de minimiser les couts et de maximiser les couts financiers, car la proximité entre les structures de gestion des conflits fonciers et les bénéficiaires offre l\'avantage d\'un accès facile mais aussi d\'éviter les couts exorbitants dans la gestion des conflits fonciers.  D\'autre part, les structures de proximité peuvent assurer un suivi permanent des conflits résolus pour éviter leur rebondissement.  En 2012 environ 99 cas de conflits fonciers sont traités par les structures locales avec succès dans le territoire de Masisi (CLPC, NRCF), ce qui montre un début d\'appropriation de la médiation pa');

Approximate 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C in 542 communities, 281 of which are located entirely or mostly (50% or more of their built up area) in Area C. The draft Operational Coordination Plan details these communities further and clarifies how many are covered by Detailed Outline Plans. As the development pressure on Area C is increasing, it is important to accelerate the planning effort and to address the serious planning backlog, as evidenced by the large amount of demolition orders and/or stop work orders issued.Furthermore it is essential that affected village councils are fully aware of the need for planning; the risks involved and, are as such, in a position to engage with the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to negotiate the approval of their plans on behalf of their communities. It is important also that they are in position to guide the implementation of the plans. Until now, most planning efforts were led by IPCC, a local NGO. If the intent is to seriously scale up the planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. This means that, apart from IPCC who played a key role in piloting planning in Area C and in supporting Village Councils in their negotiations with the Israeli Civil Administration, other capacity will need to be mobilized. Recently, private sector firms have been contracted to prepare five lots of plans for Area C. Coordinating all ongoing initiatives will require capacity to support Village Councils ensuring proper community participation and ownership, coherence and exchange of lessons learnt, quality control and support in the negotiations with the ICA. Currently, the engagement with the ICA on the approval of plans is not structured. The situation on the ground and the impact of plans is also not properly documented. Better monitoring is needed with improved information sharing as parties are seeking a common ground in terms of numbers and progress made. Apart from reducing the risk of displacement, by creating a planning framework that helps to overcome standing demolition or stop work orders, the main reasons to prepare Detailed Outline Plans is to guide concrete improvements in the living conditions of Palestinian Communities in Area C. So far, there is insufficient link between the efforts in planning and investment initiatives.Therefore the project will build upon existing initiatives and other systems and approaches that have a proven record of success, while also incorporating the challenges and lessons-learned into its actions moving forward. For example, a good source of knowledge includes the International Peace and Cooperation Centre, which has played a leading role in providing planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. After many years working in the area, it has now built up a solid base of experience in engaging and supporting Palestinian communities, ensuring their ownership of the planning process, in their interaction with the ICA. Indeed, IPCC is at the forefront of developing relevant planning approaches and it is well-placed to help build the capacity of the Palestinian private sector in relation to planning. Moreover, the close relationship of UN-Habitat and IPCC demonstrates the basis of lessons-learned in the formation of the logic of this intervention.Further, UN-Habitat\'s played a strategic role in the development of the Strategic Action Plan since September 2009, jointly reviewing with relevant civil society organisations, OCHA, UNSCO and the Quartet, how planning could be made more effective to prevent displacement and facilitate local development of Palestinian Communities in Area C. These actions enhanced the understanding of the Agency in the issues faced in planning in this area of the world.Finally, there was an explicit request from the Palestinian Authority to UN-Habitat to mobilize its planning expertise in Area C, to provide a link with the broader work of the UN on the topic, both at the humanitarian, development and political level and to facilitate the advocacy work by the international community.The project aims at improving the Palestinian management structure and process with involvement of all relevant domestic and international community stakeholders, as well to facilitate technical cooperation with the ICA in the appropriate cases. In this respect the project wants to develop planning standards and guidelines for qualitative community-driven local Outline Planning.');

Key stakeholder groups will be targeted directly through developing their understanding and capacity around urban law to allow for culturally sensitive urban redevelopment. The project, through the review of the Egyptian legal framework and the identification of urban redevelopment and densification best practice, will analyse the current legal systems operating at city and national level, with regard to land regularization to encourage planned development on the urban fringe and will improve the capacities of local authorities to design and implement legal reforms. Different methods, including local consultations and the convening of Expert Group Meetings, will be used to gauge demand. An important element of such engagement will be enabling local to national dialogue to assist law makers at national and local level to work in concert. Moreover, collaboration with other development partners, particularly UN Agencies and bilateral development agencies such as GIZ, will be sought within the framework of national development strategies and in the spirit of harmonization. Internally, the project activities will be complement and support UN-Habitat\'s planning initiatives in the country.The selection of pilot sites and locations for further analysis of urban development trends will be categorized into four main groups. The first category will focus on urban expansion in metropolitan areas (Greater Cairo Region). Here, two locations will be chosen, examining the process of urban expansion on agriculture, privately owned land, as well as exploring urban expansion dynamics on state owned land. In addition to that, a second category will be investigating urban expansion in a small/ secondary city (defined in the Egyptian context as city with about 50,000 inhabitants). The third category will focus on exploring the expansion in a rural setting The fourth category will analyze the establishment of new towns as a policy to attain sustainable urban expansion. Based on the typology of new town developments in Egypt, particular attention will be paid on understanding development dynamics of Satellite, Twin and independent cities.

Upper Egypt is inhabited by 40% of the national population, and by 66% of Egypt\'s extreme poor, making it the most vulnerable region in the country. With a poverty incidence of 41.2%, Upper Egypt is almost doubling the national average of 21.6%.Minya was selected as the target governorate in consultation with the Government of Egypt because it displays high levels of persistent poverty, as well as the second lowest HDI ranking amongst governorates. It is the most populated in Upper Egypt, with approximately 4.6 million inhabitants, 82% of which live in rural areas. There are over 3,000 villages in the governorate, comprising more than 30% of the poorest villages of Upper Egypt. A number of assessments recently conducted under UN programs show high levels of unemployment and underemployment in Minya, especially in rural areas and among youth and women. The post-revolution economic downturn has triggered a rise in crime rates, food insecurity, child labor and added pressure on existing infrastructure and services as well as on local natural resources. Inter-linkages and dynamics among human security threats observed in Minya are described below.To work towards this purpose, UN-Habitat will work in partnership with other UN agencies ( UN RC, UNIDO, UN Women, ILO, IOM,) involved in the project to create and build the capacity of community and youth groups to play an active role in identifying community needs, formulating action plans, designing implementation strategies and fundraising from local partners. The project will coordinate with governmental authorities ( MoLD and Governorate of Minya) to ensure the mainstreaming of community engagement in planning and resource allocation.Economic security of vulnerable communities will be achieved through creation of a participatory plat form, human security forum, that will be a tool to identify real community needs and prepare community action plans with regards to achieving human economic security. UN-Habitat will adopt an urban upgrading approach to achieve this purpose, through neighborhood upgrading initiatives and other initiatives related to urban upgrading and governance.As a direct intervention, the project will implement upgrading projects which will serve beneficiaries to be more economically active and self- sufficient. To achieve this target, Human Security Forum will be created and activated on both village level and district level, the HS forum will include the active community leaders and members from different sectors like youth, women and community focal points adding to governmental officials and NGOs. The project will build the capacity of Human Security Forum to identify the community needs, form an action plan and to be able to raise resources for the implementation of the projects. An integrated capacity building program will be conducted to enable the HS fora to play its designed role. Training will be conducted by different project partners according to their mandates to provide the HS fora with skills to identify the community needs, creating dialogue with the government to meet the needs, conduct fund raising activities for sustainability and acting as a communication channel between the local community and local authorities.In order to sustain the interventions , the project will work to mainstream the the HS forum through up -scaling the concept to the governorate level, a linkage between the district level HS forum and the governorate of Minya to assure that the needs of the local communities are reflected in the upper level planning process. The HS forum will act as a bottom -up mechanism for planning and resource allocation');

In this sense, theproject aims to broaden the scope of specific urban interventions in order toreach further and address inequity and poverty challenges that have beengrowing as rapid as the urbanization of Medellin has been moving forward.With this in mind, and considering that ASUD is a global pilot of UN-Habitat,and therefore it is considered to be part of a global learning platform, the followingoutputs and activities will be prioritized: To support the institutional reform that the cityrequires to adjust itself in order to face growing urban challenges within amore comprehensive concept of “Habitat”. To achieve this, the project will conduct studies on all institutional structure/capacities with special emphasis onISVIMED as the leading institution on social housing. Throughout consultationsand international references, the project will propose a new legal andinstitutional framework aligned with the city\'s habitat requirements. Anawareness campaign regarding institutional adjustments will be conducted in theframework of the global UN-Habitat campaign I\'m a City Changer.To create an UN-Habitat Regional City Lab as ahub for the global institute of excellence for capacity development of citiesand urban managers, promoted by UN-Habitat\'s HQ, to contribute in the promotion of South-South and decentralized cooperation,to provide specific training for urban managers and community in general,provide technical support on urban issues to the ACCC and other institutions,promote cooperation on urban issues among Colombian cities, leverage theexpertise acquired by the city on local sustainable urban policies, conduct research,document best national and local practices, facilitate partnerships amongpublic, private, social, national, local and international urban stakeholders, andsupport Medellin and UN-Habitat in the organization of World Urban Forum 7 –WUF 7 to take place in the city in 2014. The hub will also support the processof citizen ownership and awareness for the continuing transformation of thecity through UN-Habitat\'s campaign \"I\'m a City Changer\". It will alsodocument and monitor the strategy of the Metropolitan Green Belt, establishedin the Local Development Plan, the experience of the Metropolitan Area of Vallede Aburra, the UN-Habitat Participatory Inclusive Land-Readjustment exercise“PILaR”, and will provide support to the development of Partial Plans in thecity, considering a participatory and inclusive approach.To design and support the implementation of anurban planning activity at neighborhood level in close coordination withUN-Habitat\'s Participatory and Inclusive Land Readjustment project – PILaR tobe implemented in Medellin. This pilot initiative will work as a learningexperience for the city to promote a more participatory and inclusive urbandevelopment model and will work hand in hand with UN-Habitat PILaR team. It will be properly documented in order tobecome a pilot experience for the UN-Habitat Regional City Lab.');

A UN humanitarian coordination framework for multi sectoralpurposes will be developed at Damascus level and piloted in the city of Homs.Results and experience will lead to scaling up the approach in Syria in otherkey locations. The primary objective ofdeveloping a coordination framework for UN country team is to decentralizehumanitarian coordination at neighbourhood and city level to be as close aspossible to communities, municipalities and neighborhoods. Technical assistance to local partners ondefining recovery and response in key sectors is part of the pilot. The city ofHoms is proposed as a pilot due to the growing humanitarian needs, presence ofUN operational hub and a large number of actors that need to be coordinated toleverage capacities. Coordination will take place in two neighborhoods as apilot where actors covering basic services, health education, shelter and otherareas will be convened together to promote coordination in an integratedmanner. The city scale is comprised of two levels: The neighborhoods in Syriancities are often an area comprising population between 2.000 and up to 250.000inhabitants. The two neighborhoods and communities will be selected throughlocal community meetings with community based organizations, IDPs and communitymembers. The goal is to choose one neighbourhood each in Government andopposition controlled areas to begin neighbourhood emergency response planning inthese affected neighborhoods. Since the neighborhoods in Syria are normallydense and are currently hosting large numbers of IDPs, local emergency actionplans for each neighbourhood will be further divided into 20 communities asunits.Providing access to public services as education or healthcare as wellas ensuring functioning basic infrastructure services of water, sanitation,waste collection and energy can protect people from further deprivation andviolence by reducing immediate risks. The local emergency plans will identifylocal community initiatives to be supported in 20 communities during theproject duration. Capacities of local NGO, Syrian Arab Red Crescent and community basedorganizations will be strengthened in this process. Neighbourhood based localemergency plans will facilitate decision making, consensus, prioritization ofefforts already taking place or in need of support.

The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow andlopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. Therationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization ofprosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies thatthreaten rather than enhance sustainability.Byestimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globallycomparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for trackingprogress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations incities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspondto locally available data, policy priorities and needs.

The project will support the Land Commission in fulfilling its role as the leading agency on reforms in the land sector and in pursuing more effective land governance in Liberia. It will also support much-needed and important outreach and education on the Land Commission\'s landmark new Land Rights Policy, finalized in May 2013, which provides clear and important guarantees for, inter alia, rights for communities to customary land, and women\'s rights to land. New priorities under the proposed project will add an additional and needed new focus on urban land disputes and on concession-related disputes. A combination of activities and research will be undertaken, which will feed into an ultimate policy on alternative dispute resolution, based on Liberian experiences and traditions, human rights principles, and national and international best practices. The policy formulation process will also include attention to differing effects on men and women, rural and urban dwellers, and winners and losers in land disputes.The main focus of the project is on pilot Land Coordination Centres (LCCs), set up under the last tranche of PBF funding. Research on existing land dispute resolution mechanisms funded by UN-Habitat in 2011 found that multiple community-level mechanisms already existed[1]. Thus, rather than adding a new actor to the mix, the LC decided to set up centres that would provide a umbrella to coordinate all those ad hoc community actors into a system. The LCCs do outreach and education, establish a common documentation system for dispute resolvers, track the work done by all dispute resolvers to avoid forum shopping, keep a repository of documents and data, follow up on resolved disputes to help ensure sustainability, and provide training and technical assistance to community members in their dispute resolution work. The LCCs also collect and document best practices and lessons learned. UN-Habitat and USAID\'s Land Conflict Resolution Project (LCRP) are jointly supporting the LCCs. LCCs were piloted in 5 counties covering 10 districts determined by LC research to be land dispute “hotspots”.The project has three major expected accomplishmentsEA1.

The Overall Purpose of the MCCA is to mainstream climate change into the Myanmar policy development and reform agenda. Climate change mainstreaming will result in the following:1. Increase The Government of Myanmar\'s ability to respond to climate change through strengthening of the climate change related institutional and policy environment through sharing of technical knowledge and best practise, training and institutional support.2.

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.');

They have been living for long years inside the Old City and hold the memory of the place.The project will provide to the residents of the targeted historical complexa better living environment through rehabilitation works and eliminating the risk factors resulting fromliving in deteriorated buildings.The rehabilitation works will address variousaspects and stages of decay, such as structural instability, unsafe electrical anddysfunctional mechanical installations, humidity, inadequate lighting andaccess difficulties, especially for the elderly.In addition, the resident families will enjoy agood provision of open space that accommodates private courtyards, domesticgardens of indigenous Palestinian local character, social and seasonal events.Meanwhile, the historical character of thecomplex and the houses will be preserved.The project also addresses the problems of lack of social and community services for youth ,lack of variety in the commercial and Palestinian touristic attractions and services inside the Old City. In response to this, the project entails the rehabilitation of a vacantdecayed and deserted space on the ground floor of the targeted historical complex.The space will beconverted into a new civic center that will act as a hub for a diverse range ofvisitors and youth of both genders.The action will comprise a package of activitiesand commercial uses that will be unique and will fill a gap in the servicesoffered inside the Old City, hence create an attractive hub for its residentsand visitors alike. Hereby, the project will capitalize on the strategiclocation of the premises -being adjacent to one of the centrally located marketareas inside the Old City (Khan Alzait) in the Islamic Quarter- and thehistoric character of the complex to promote Palestinian identity. Hence, itwill counter act Israeli policies that aim at weakening the Palestinianidentity inside the Old City.In addition, the project addresses the problems of youth social problem, and the high rates of school dropouts.The civic center will include youth knowledge andcareer guidance facilities. It will provide them with a space that is equippedwith modern tools of communication, knowledge gaining and self-expression. Itwill also provide youth development programs that are focused on careerdevelopment and education guidance.The design of the civic centre and its functional programwill cater for creating a spatial setting that allows the Palestinian youth ofboth genders, who suffer from isolation and limited development choices to enjoy an attractive atmosphere of social andcultural diverse interactions throughthe center activities . The interaction will be directed to focus on learningfrom Palestinian entrepreneurs, accomplished young professionals, and thecentre operation staff and global visitors. In addition, the operation plan ofthe centre will accommodate regular events that focus on youthdevelopment. The project will build on the experience, existing programsand networks of Al Quds University to establish and operate the above mentioneddevelopment programs. The program will include education and career guidancespecialized training, in addition to exposure and links to regional andinternational capacity building initiatives and job opportunities. This willhelp youth graduating from Palestinian universities to overcome some of thebarriers that narrow their perspective towards education and reduces theiraccess to rewarding jobs. Students who live in the Old City will be given preferential consideration for benefiting from the abovementioned opportunities andactivities.Aclosely related matter to the above mentioned problems, is youth weak access to employment and jobopportunities. In this regards, the projectis anchored around engaging Palestinianyouth, in particular Palestinian students and newly graduating students fromAl-Quds University, in various stages of the development process.

As the development pressure on Area C is increasing, it is important to accelerate the planning effort and to address the serious planning backlog, as evidenced by the large amount of demolition orders and/or stop work orders issued. Furthermore it is essential that affected village councils are fully aware of the need for planning; the risks involved and, are as such, in a position to engage with the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to negotiate the approval of their plans on behalf of their communities. It is important also that they are in position to guide the implementation of the plans. Until now, most planning efforts were led by IPCC, a local NGO. If the intent is to seriously scale up the planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. This means that, apart from IPCC who played a key role in piloting planning in Area C and in supporting Village Councils in their negotiations with the Israeli Civil Administration, other capacity will need to be mobilized. Recently, private sector firms have been contracted to prepare five lots of plans for Area C. Coordinating all ongoing initiatives will require capacity to support Village Councils ensuring proper community participation and ownership, coherence and exchange of lessons learnt, quality control and support in the negotiations with the ICA. Currently, the engagement with the ICA on the approval of plans is not structured. The situation on the ground and the impact of plans is also not properly documented.

This in turn will allow the people of Liberia to be aware of and exercise their rights to land, to improve their security of tenure, and thus use their land more effectively, promoting peace, stability and economic growth. Strengthening the Land Commission\'s capacity will be effectuated through core support and embedded technical assistance to the Land Commission, and targeted initiatives in selected areas (2 municipalities and 1 county).Despite its achievements to date – and in light of the new challenges it will face as the new Agency is established – the Land Commission still has a number of key outputs which it is mandated to complete. In this regard the Land Commission has identified three specific areas which are vital to the achievement of these remaining outputs over the remaining life of the Commission: continuation of core support to the Land Commission through support provided to the Technical Secretariat, which will also allow for a transition into the envisaged new Agency, continuation of support for urban land use and management, and support of the national tribal certificates inventory project. Due to the limitations of the Liberian Government budget, there is no Government support for the technical staff of the Commission to undertake all of this important work. The Commissioners cannot implement the ambitious work programme alone. It is only through the continuation of the core funding and technical assistance for the programme staff, currently supported by SIDA through UN-Habitat, that the Commission can employ and retain high-performing staff. The strong capacity of the Commission has been recognized by other donors, who also recognize that if SIDA had not made the core support and technical assistance for the staff possible, they would not have had a capable partner who could efficaciously absorb their funds and undertake productive donor-funded activities. SIDA\'s core support and UN-Habitat\'s technical assistance for the Commission\'s technical staff has also therefore been both critical and catalytic. It is all the more so at this crucial moment in the life of the Commission, with just over a year left on its mandate and a delicate and complicated transition to a new Agency ahead.

A key philosophy of the programme is that it will look at the city as a whole rather than from the more common sectorial approach. It will also look at cities in their regional contexts.As illustrated in Figure 1 below, two streams of activities in the first and second years will lead to informed policy analysis and a set of 17 action plans (one per participating city), namely (i) identification of indicators and city-level data collection on multiple dimensions of prosperity, using UN-Habitat\'s City Prosperity Index and (ii) reviews of existing Saudi planning practices and consideration of principles and approaches to a new urban agenda. The participatory processes built into the programme will result in inclusive, evidence-based policy analysis and customised action plans, in direct support of Saudi Arabia\'s Country Programme Outcome 1.2.  The data generated will feed into 17 national reports an all-encompassing State of Saudi Cities Report and a State of Saudi Youth Report. These sets of information will also support the Saudi national reporting to Habitat III.Through using UN-Habitat\'s City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous.  It includes various indices and indicators that are relevant to cities and important for prosperity-oriented public policy-making. The Index focuses on individual cities and measures prosperity across seven dimensions –productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity, environmental sustainability, urban form and structure; and institutions, laws and governance (see Table 1).The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories above. UN-Habitat\'s Wheel of Urban Prosperity, which will be used as a tool in the programme, illustrates the balanced development of the five dimensions “spokes” of prosperity (productivity, infrastructure development, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, and environmental sustainability) and the two elements of urban form and structure and institutions, laws and governance (in the centre of the wheel). Table 1:Seven dimensions of prosperityProductivity	Contributes to economic growth and development, generates income, provides decent jobs and equal opportunities for all through effective economic policies and reforms.Infrastructure development	Provides adequate infrastructure- water, sanitation, roads, information and communication technology- in order to improve living standards and enhance productivity, mobility and connectivity.Quality of life	Enhances the use of public space for the sake of community cohesion and civic identity, and guarantees individual and material safety and security.Equity and social inclusion	Ensures equitable (re)distribution of the benefits of prosperity, reduces poverty and the incidence of slums, protects the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, enhances gender and youth equality, and ensures civic participation in the social, political and cultural spheres.Environmental sustainability	Values the protection of the urban environment and natural assets while ensuring growth, pursues energy efficiency, reduces pressure on surrounding land and natural resources, reduces environmental losses through creative, environment-enhancing solutions.Urban form and structure 	Recognized the element of urban planning that determines the urban form, including  street planning and how it influences the other dimensions of prosperity, including street networks and mobility patterns.Institutions, laws and governance	Government institutions, laws and governance will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to takeThrough using the City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous. The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories. Since shared and balanced development is a crucial feature of prosperity, none of the dimensions must prevail over the others and all must be kept roughly ‘equal\' on the path of prosperity.

It is conceived within the framework of the Joint UN programming approach UN-Habitat, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO as the main UN Agency partners to collaborate with GoG partners on providing improved and resilient WASH facilities and services in disaster prone communities in the 3 Northern Regions. In line with the outcomes 4 and 5 of the UNDAF, this project also provides a framework for DFATD to partner with the UN team in this effort and to contribute to GoG\'s efforts towards the implementation of the Ghana Plan of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation.Consistent with Ghana\'s aspirations, the vision and collective programme of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the period 2012-2016 seeks to advance a coherent vision for the UN system in support of key priorities of the Government\'s Development Agenda. The UNDAF aligns with the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) through four thematic areas[1] including infrastructure and human settlements development. WASH is an UNDAF outcome area under the infrastructure and human settlements development thematic area. The 2012-2016 UNDAF includes a key programme component on water, sanitation and hygiene to be implemented in the 5 most deprived regions (Central, Northern, Upper East, Upper West and Volta) of Ghana. The UNDAF Action Plan (UAP) puts some focus on the poorest regions of the country, in particular the activities of the Joint UN Office in Tamale, which focuses on the three northern regions, and includes support to disaster prone communities in these three regions.Natural disaster occurrence in Ghana consists of droughts, epidemic outbreaks, floods, and wildfires. In the 3 Northern regions, disasters significantly impact vulnerable populations in disaster prone areas, and may lead to unnecessary losses of social and economic capital. In particular, recurrent flooding events, which are the most pervasive in terms of financial damages and numbers of people affected, usually result in the disruption of services from WASH facilities, which could lead to significant damages to property and trigger other emergency situations such as outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera, and other water related/borne diseases. The combination of these effects reduces the productivity of the population and the losses they suffer are immense and seriously affect their economic and social circumstances. These events tend to have devastating effects on the development of affected communities. Having to ensure that when such floods occur the quality of water supply is not contaminated (during collection, handling, storage, and use) also presents immense challenges to the health of these communities. Rehabilitation costs are usually unaffordable and communities have suffered a drastic fall in their living conditions and opportunities for future development, pushing them further into poverty and deprivation. The situation is further aggravated in those communities where there is a lack of WASH facilities and services. In such circumstances, the challenges include the prevalence of water borne, vector borne and sanitation related diseases as a result of poor drinking water quality and inadequate sanitation. Women, children and the youth suffer the most from the effects of this lack of access to WASH facilities and related services. Initiatives that address and improve the WASH situation for people in disaster prone communities contribute significantly to address most MDGs.In a recent report, the National Disaster Monitoring Organization (NADMO) indicated that it had taken a census of people living in flood prone areas of the country, including the northern regions, and had allocated safe havens in these communities to prepare for the onset of the major rains. The project will work in close collaboration with NADMO in this context, and contribute to WASH components with respect to prior preparations towards mitigating disaster events, make recommendations for interventions during such events, and implement WASH solutions that could be resilient to the effects in the disaster prone communities.');

The GHS encourages theformation and participatory management of multilateral partnerships at thenational and local level to ensure a “level playing field” of negotiations,through the creation of National Habitat Committees; the enrichment of theglobal strategy by localised, contextualised successful projects, programmesand strategies and; more importantly, the promotion of inclusive, gender based,rights based equity measures for the urban poor. The GHS therefore assumes adouble tracked approach: it is neither top-down nor bottom-up, but rather triesto instigate horizontal governance at all levels of intervention.The GHS builds on the Global Strategy forShelter to the Year 2000 (GSS2000), which was approved by 158 Member Statesbetween 1988 and 2000 and implemented by UN-Habitat in collaboration withHabitat Agenda partners. Several lessonshave been drawn from this former global initiative, notably that thecommodification of housing and the prevalence of market-dominated housingproduction have negatively impacted the availability of affordable housingsupply. Additionally, generalized urban sprawl, the promotion of home ownershipover other tenure modalities coupled with the failure of housing markets toadequately respond to a variety of demands have contributed to increasingeconomic inequality and a divide between developed and under developed urbanareas. The GHS seeks to readdress issues encountered inthe implementation of the GSS2000 at global and country levels, mainly in thecritical developing regions aforementioned, where inequalities and urbanpoverty are more manifest and have had a greater impact on access to adequateand affordable housing. This project will enable the practical roll-outof the Strategy and the development of related capacity in six Least DevelopedCountries. The project will draw on global processes to formulate housing andslum upgrading strategies that integrate the above concerns, implementingUN-Habitat\'s Global Housing Strategy at country-level. Six countries will beselected across the three regions of Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America andthe Caribbean, as per the criteria outlined in section 2.2 below.The Project will also adopt aregional approach of capacity building. The GHS approach is expected to resultin an increased commitment of additional countries towards the right to adequatehousing, and the principles of inclusive, rights-based and gender-based policydevelopment. Enhanced South-South cooperation will be sought to supportcapacity development in each country, and the replication and scaling up of theinitiative in additional countries of each region. At the global level, it isexpected that this approach will result not only in the (re)positioning ofhousing within the global contemporary debate on economically viable,environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive cities but also on criticaloutputs such as: shift in thinking and practice; systemic reforms promoted;strengthened linkages of housing with other parts of the economy; anddecentralization of housing production and delivery systems.');

Themain steps were the following:1989: Adoption of the National Housing Strategy that covered allhousing components and produced a set of recommendations that governed theJordanian housing sector\'s activities for 20 years.1992: Merging of former Housing Corporation and UrbanDevelopment Department to form the HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION(HUDC) to become the official umbrella for the housing sector. HUDC wasmandated to work in two areas: housing production and housing policies. 1996: Launching of the Housing Reform Project that addressed themajor issues of the housing sector. The main accomplishments of the reformwere:    establishment of Jordan Mortgage      Refinance Company  granting the private sector rights to      use standards (plot sizes) developed by HUDC  launching partnership with the private      sector,   changing zoning criteria : re-zoning and      down zoning for smaller plots  cancellation of the Housing Bank law to      encourages banking competition in housing finance  rationalizing of housing subsidies.TheHUDC\'s mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activatepublic-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to accessadequate housing, A second function of HUDC would be Detailed Action Planningin collaboration with MOMA (UPD) and municipalities, for selected urban areas.This task should be financed by the clients/beneficiaries. It will entail:. identifying with municipalities areas envisaged for future housingdevelopment;. liaising with UPD to review their macro-zoning plans;. preparing action plans (trunk infrastructure development) for priorityareas.  Solving this problem is a priority for two reasons. The first is the high numbers of refugeesthat have arrived in Jordan, all of whom need somewhere to stay. It is unlikely that there will be a swiftsolution to the Syrian crisis, and it is anticipated that Syrian refugees arelikely to stay in in Jordan for at least the next 5-10 years. A solution that providesadequate housingat scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both ofwhom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the comingyears.The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families arefinding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housingfor young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supplyis becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.The solution contained in this programme will address both elements ofthis immediate problem. Jordanians, whohave the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their owndown payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgagerepayment. Although smaller than currenthousing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded oncethe mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian andother refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rentalhousing at affordable rates.The proposal is toconstruct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed tobe convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line withexisting market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families inthe near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation andlegislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may beconstructed individually on an owner\'s existing land, as well as on a largerscale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tractscontributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of theoverall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, crosssubsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially theoverall affordable unit cost). As initiallycontemplated, the owner/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at marketrates. Purchase cost is expected to beJD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, inorder to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanianfamily in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser mayreceive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the marketrate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordablerent) [direct from government][direct from donors/government] with respect tothe loan in question.

While reasonably effective for specific threats, this approach is largely palliative, i.e. defining risk, and retro-fitting remedial measures to reduce it. However, there is no means to test the efficacy of these remedial efforts until another disaster occurs that meets or exceeds the original design limits.Many urban risk reduction initiatives address specific hazards. These are usually well-known (or at least well-publicized), and more recently since the ‘climate change agenda\' has become a global, well-funded, and extremely well-articulated agenda including city strategies to cope with a range of climate-driven threats and mitigating their impact on the global climate. However, approaches often ignore other hazards including the largest killers such as earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as automobile accidents, fires and industrial or technological disasters, and social and political crisis.The closest approximation of a tool for building resilience is the UN-ISDR\'s 10 point checklist associated with their Making Cities Resilient (MCR) global Campaign. However, recent testing of this framework reveals its primary weaknesses which derive from a framework of principles that are self-assessed by local governments, and self-driven with no clear standards that planners, engineers, architects, economists, and other experts who manage cities can target and use. The results are qualitative in nature, and while clearly a good foundation for advocating the resilience agenda globally, will demand further strategies and tools to ensure cities actually do become measurably more resilient.While some developments focusing on multi-hazard approaches, such as the one above, are emerging, to date there is no system for defining forward-looking, integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder urban systems approach to planning and developing urban settlements capacity to withstand and recover from crisis, i.e. achieving measurable resilience.The URIP fills a significant sustainable development planning and implementation gap at a time when cities are assuming ever-increasing local, regional, national and global socio-economic significance.');

Inparticular, in Malawi the Minister of Land and Housing, in charge ofInfrastructure, requested UNHabitat to assist in the assessment of SchoolSafety, replicating the experience of UN-Habitat DIPECHO III and GFDRR inMozambique. In Mozambique the work delivered by UN-Habitat and NationalPartners until now, will require fine-tuning. In fact, as proven throughDIPECHO III and the DIMSUR (Technical Centre for Urban Resilience and DisasterRisk), Governments have been sensitized to the need to take into account localpractices into policy action, but still need support to transformbest-practices into policies.-Problem 3.

At the same time, handlingland disputes and promoting an effective land governance system enable economicrecovery and help to tackle poverty, which removes one of the causes of ongoingconflict. The linkages between land disputes, peace, stability and economicrecovery require innovative approaches to deal with land issues in a holisticmanner. Tackling land issues will contribute to reconciliation, facilitatereturn and reintegration for IDPs and refugees, reduce the risks of armedconflict, and enable a stable environment for livelihood improvement through secureland tenure and access to means of production. The recognition of thesignificance of land issues is gaining momentum in the agendas of bothstabilization and development actors, and approaches based on lessons derivedfrom previous interventions need to be adapted to the context. 3.1.Land disputes as a symptom of underlying causes andnot as an end in themselves:Many interventions in the land sector are focusing on dealing with landdisputes through mediation. Mediating land disputes is a necessary step but itis not sufficient. There is a need to tackle the root causes of land disputes,knowing that conflict derives from various factors (legal, ethnic, political,institutions). An innovativeapproach may need to perceive land issues through the lens of governance. Thelack of state authority and the failure of the governance system as a whole haverepercussions on land management and allocation. The former stabilizationframework in Eastern DR Congo (ISSSS) only focused on superficial aspects whilemitigating disputes and conflict over land. The approach did not, however, seriouslyconsider land conflicts as a matter of governance.3.2.Long-term approach to comprehensively deal withland issuesA humanitarian approach to dealing with land issues in post conflictsettings prevailed in the case of DR Congo. Actors were mainly targeting quicksolutions through ad hocinterventions without developing a long-term vision for the land sector. Aneffective long-term vision requires the development of a realistic agenda that takesa comprehensive approach and links land issues with other critical sectors for peace and stability,such as security, decentralization and the restoration of state authority.The long-term solution in DR Congo on land issues is to reconcilelegitimacy and legality regarding land management and governance. The ongoingland reform process led by the national government becomes an avenue to capturechanges in the land governance system and to reach durable solutions to theland conflicts. According to the strategic plan developed in 2013, the GoDRC isexpected to come up with a new land policy from which should derive a new landlegal framework adapted to the new context of the DRC, and this by end of 2016.But due to some delay on the land program implementation this timeline needs tobe reviewed to be realistic. But in the meantime, some keys can be addressed aslong as the government is committed (regulation of land customary rights,recognition of alternative disputes resolution mechanisms as part of theinstitutional framework.3.3.Scaling up experiences from local to national:Until now, most interventions dealing with land issues focus on thecommunity level with weak linkages to provincial and national levels. Working with local communities should notexclude certain levels of cooperation with both the provincial and nationallevels. Evidence has shown that powerfulactors with influence at the local level of the political crisis in DR Congoare not necessarily themselves present on the ground. Some are based in capitalsof provinces while others are in Kinshasa occupying political functions; usingproxy means to manage their interests at the local level. 3.4.Weakness of interventions in the land sector:Most of the interventions in the land sector are carried out by localNGOs, mainly focusing on land dispute resolution. The number of NGOs is verylimited taking into account the number of land disputes emerging at thecommunity level. Some community members do not have access to formal or wellorganized dispute resolution mechanisms in the areas covered by UN-Habitatprogram (For example, Irumu and Mombassa Territories in Ituri,, Haut Plateauxin South Kivu). Disequilibrium in the geographical coverage may lead todisharmony in the treatment of land issues, leading only to partial solutionsto the problem. At the same time, many NGOs lack the technical capacity to deal withland issues. Based of the inherent sensitivity of land issues, actors workingat the community level require a minimum expertise to avoid doing harm whendealing with land disputes. Land interventions will always have the potentialto aggravate conflicts. Buildingcapacity for both community members and local organizations is a perquisite fora successful resolution of land disputes.Despite');

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.');

Approved atthe highest level, a national urban policy should provide the general frameworkto orient public interventions in urban areas and be a reference for sectoralministries and service providers. It should also be the key reference forlegislative institutional reform. The National Urban Planning Policy is also agood instrument for public and political awareness of the gains to be obtainedfrom sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promoteconsultation with urban stakeholders. Successfulnational urban policies generally yield the following results: (a) theidentification of urban development priorities towards socially andeconomically equitable and environmentally friendly urban and nationaldevelopment; (b) guidance on the future development of the national urban systemand its spatial configuration concretized through National and Regional SpatialPlans for Territorial Development; (c) better coordination and guidance ofactions by national actors, as well as lower levels of government in allsectors; (d) increased and more coordinated private and public investments inurban development and consequent improvement of cities productivity,inclusiveness and environmental conditions. (c) Buildand harness capacity at metropolitan, regional, national and global levels, supportedby dedicated strategies and programmes, including human resources development,tool development, organizational development and institutional strengthening toachieve sustainable development.

Pour se faire, il s\'articule autour de trois des piliers de la stratégie : -	Promotion du dialogue démocratique : à travers le renforcement de capacité des structures communautaires qui canalisent les discours communautaires, la sensibilisation des communautés sur la gestion de la RFO et la résolution pacifique des conflits, l\'instauration des mécanismes communautaires de prévention et résolution des conflits ;-	Restauration de l\'autorité de l\'Etat : grâce à l\'amélioration de l\'accès aux services administratifs essentiels, dont le déploiement des éléments formés de la PNC, l\'amélioration de la situation socio-économique, sécuritaire et sociale induite de la réhabilitation de la route par la méthode HIMO, l\'appui matériel et techniques aux institutions judiciaires ;-	Réinsertion, réintégration et relance économique : en créant des débouchés économiques pour les groupes à risques (femmes chefs de ménages, femmes vulnérables, femmes des policiers et des militaires, populations autochtones), en améliorant le secteur agricole et les activités génératrices de revenus comme sources de moyens de subsistance. La composante UNHABITAT de ce projet vise à toucher directement 10,000 ménages (y compris des ménages-femmes) de la zone bénéficiant des activités de prévention et de résolution de conflit à travers les plateformes de dialogue communautaire. La minorité autochtone (pygmée) sera représentée dans les plateformes de dialogues par un nombre minimum de représentant et bénéficiera également des activités génératrices des revenus. Bien plus, les organisation communautaires, notamment 3 antennes de la CFI, 10 Comités locaux d\'éveil, 5 Comités locaux de gestion des ressources naturelles RFO, 12 maisons de femmes et 10 organisations féminines, bénéficieront des activités de formation pour les rendre plus efficaces dans la sensibilisation sur le droit foncier et les méthodes alternatives des conflits fonciers, ainsi que, pour les antennes de la CFI seulement,  dans la prise en charge des conflits fonciers. De façon indirecte, c\'est toute la population de la zone d\'intervention (Mambasa, Epulu, Niania), environ 25,000 ménages, qui sera touchée, ainsi que le  Gouvernement provincial et de district avec une meilleure représentation, un fonctionnement et une qualité de service améliorés, particulièrement au niveau des chefferies du territoire de Mambasa et de l\'administration foncière. La logique d\'intervention et le séquençage des activités dans le projet est très important et doit se baser sur la mise en place d\'un dialogue communautaire visant à identifier les conflits au niveau de la communauté et entre les communautés et de développer toute une série d\'activités autour de ces plateformes de dialogue afin de résoudre ces conflits directement ou indirectement.  A cet effet les activités du pilier dialogue démocratique seront mises en œuvre en premier sur une période d\'au moins 3 mois afin de documenter les conflits pour ensuite préparer la représentation de ces communautés. Les activités sous les piliers RAE et RRR se baseront sur les résultats du dialogue et de ce fait démarreront en principe après les 3 mois initiaux. Néanmoins ; certaines activités préparatoires seront mis en œuvre dès le début de projet. La promotion du dialogue démocratique se fera à travers d\'une part des structures existantes d\'identification et de médiation de conflit qui ont été mises en place par le Réseau Haki na Amani (RHA), il s\'agit des Comités Locaux d\'éveil (CLE). Les CLES sont des structures communautaires mises en place à l\'issue d\'un barza communautaire .

Les acteurs du projet seront formés pour comprendre les dispositions de la Réserve, compte tenu de l\'influence de la RFO dans les conflits identifiés dans la zone d\'intervention.Etant donné qu\'une grande partie des conflits les plus violents identifiés dans l\'axe d\'intervention sont des conflits fonciers (liés à l\'accès à la terre et aux ressources naturelles), ces structures communautaires pour la promotion d\'un dialogue démocratique et la pacification mises en place par le Réseau Haki na Amani (RHA) seront accompagnées et formés par les animateurs fonciers de la Commission Foncière de l\'Ituri (CFI) déployés dans l\'axe d\'intervention sur trois antennes.

A solution that providesadequate housingat scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both ofwhom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the comingyears.The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families arefinding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housingfor young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supplyis becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.The solution contained in this programme will address both elements ofthis immediate problem. Jordanians, whohave the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their owndown payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgagerepayment. Although smaller than currenthousing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded oncethe mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian andother refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rentalhousing at affordable rates.The proposal is toconstruct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed tobe convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line withexisting market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families inthe near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation andlegislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may beconstructed individually on an owner\'s existing land, as well as on a largerscale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tractscontributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of theoverall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, crosssubsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially theoverall affordable unit cost). As initiallycontemplated, the owner/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at marketrates. Purchase cost is expected to beJD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, inorder to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanianfamily in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser mayreceive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the marketrate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordablerent) [direct from government][direct from donors/government] with respect tothe loan in question.

The governments prioritized to mobilizeresources and support to provide appropriate shelters to IDPs, while the UnitedNations Humanitarian Coordination Team in Iraq also stressed the importance ofmid-term solution to needs of IDPs, both based on an understanding that securityunrest in Iraq needs to be solved in longer term. Despite the urgency of needfor convenient and durable IDP shelters, the governments have been facingfinancial and institutional constraints to respond to large number of IDPs inIraq.Emergency of the situation  The Islamic State has been expanding itsactivities and control in Iraq and Syria. Their adroit media strategy usinginternet and social media resulted in increase of numbers of the Islamic Statefighters recruited globally. Despite a series of international interventionincluding air campaigns led by the United States, the Islamic State groupcontinues to expand its territorial control. This situation implies that thenumber of IDPs in Iraq and Syria may continue to increase. Some of the majorcities in Iraq already have same number of IDPs as their original population,and communities hosting IDPs are already under severe pressure with regard to infrastructure and basic services. Therefore,providing durable shelters to IDPs is an emergency requirement in Iraq.Unpredictability of the situationIn August 2014, the IS attacks on theYazidi community and the Christian minorities in northern Iraq triggered theinternal displacement of some 800,000 persons into three governorates of theKRI, namely Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Within a month between August andSeptember 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) more thanquintupled from 96,000 to 520,000 in Dohuk, and increased by 150 per cent from117,000 to 170,000 in Erbil.Such exponential increase ofIDPs in Iraq is mainly due to emergence of the extremists group called itselfthe Islamic State and the resulting deterioration of security, which became aserious concern only recently and was not predictable.Non-Substitutability of the interventionProvision of prefabricated durable sheltersto IDPs is the most suitable solution that addresses challenges faced by IDPsand host communities. Continuing to provide tents without basic services is nota feasible solution in medium term, because tents are not designed to last forthe long period and have to be replaced every eight months. It is also notsuitable to accommodate IDPs during the winter or extreme weather conditions insummer. Lack of basic infrastructure such as water, latrines, sanitation andelectricity in the camp site will lead to cause more problems among the IDPsand host communities. Both the governments and international agencies haveagreed that the provision of prefabricated durable shelters and basic servicesis critical.');

The specific objective is to provide training, capacity-building and advocacy interventions for local administrations and local parliamentarians to better respond to the needs of uprooted women and IDPs in West Timor.  This objective should be framed with the aim of the Aid to Uprooted People and aims of the concurrent post-conflict programmes within the policies of the Indonesian government. Widespread conflict and displacement affected several regions of Indonesia, including Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West Timor, in the period 1998 and 2002. Healing and integration are still ongoing. In the case of West Timor the violent post-referendum phase in East Timor caused a large influx of pro-Indonesia fighters and sympathizers and their families, and other caught up. The influx took place in areas where traditional community conflicts had simmered for long, and where indigenous communities clashed with new elites, whether military or economic. Many of these local tensions were suppressed during the Suharto era, but erupted (and where often intentionally ignited) as of 1997. The East Timor crisis, however, caused a full blown political displacement crisis in West Timor.   The Indonesian Government expects that overall policies should now focus on \\u2018moving ahead\\u2019, on sustainable development. Conflict prevention and peace building was written in into national policies. The last National Medium Term Development Programme (2005-2009) called for a \\u2018safe and peaceful, just and democratic Indonesia with better welfare\\u2019. The present five-year plan is more specific, and calls for a special development focus on zones which are least developed, frontier, outer or post-conflict. In NTT, the government states that restitution issues have been dealt with and that peace consolidation is not at the order. Displaced people should become full citizens; they should be part of communities of citizens.        The present calls of the EU look for closure as well. The Aid to Uprooted People programme was delivering direct assistance to people affected by conflict and displacement. To phase out, in line with the expectations of the Indonesian Government, it now addresses the last groups of uprooted people which have failed to find for themselves or find assistance from others for a more secure future. These \\u2018most vulnerable\\u2019 are often women, children, female headed households and certain groups of indigenous people (or local people in hosting communities in general) which were also affected by the displacement crisis. The first 2010 call delivered assistance directly to communities. The second call was for improved monitoring and early warning capacity.

The project is designed to positively influence current practices in the building sector by promoting a systematic and comprehensive approach for stimulating a market demand for energy efficient buildings in the region.Although increased energy efficiency is highlighted as a key objective in many policy papers in the target countries, none of them has an energy efficiency law\\/bylaw\\/regulatory system for buildings and constructions. This project seeks: to mainstream energy efficiency into the existing legislation; and, to build on ongoing initiatives and develop an energy efficiency regulatory system for new and existing buildings. The project will also focus on green architecture, with the emphasis on effective policies, regulations and standards that integrate energy efficiency into building design.Without the intervention, no major improvement can be expected in the medium term in all the five countries. This project\'s regional approach will avoid duplication of efforts, will increase efficiency in the use of resources and will create competition among the countries for adopting and implementing of EEB\'s regulations. The strong awareness, capacity building and technical assistance that will link the government agencies cooperating with international experts will favor knowledge sharing and transfer.The project \\u201cPromoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in East Africa\\u201d will include five inter-related components, namely:Component 1: Energy Efficiency Data and Benchmarks in the Building Sector. This component will address existing gaps in terms of consistent, relevant and adequate data of various types of buildings (all related to EEB) in the region. It will allow formulating benchmarks, as well as identifying opportunities and energy saving potentials. Component 2: Formulation and Adoption of Energy Efficiency Codes in Buildings. This component is the core of Promoting EEB in East Africa and will target the revision of the country specific building code and municipal by laws to include EEB with reference to the specific climatic zones. Moreover, toolkits and guidelines will be developed for the application of the building code, especially in related municipal by laws. Civil servants will be capacitated to administer the implementation of the new regulations. Component 3: Awareness Raising and Capacity Building in EE, and Best Practices in the Building Sector. This component rests on three main pillars, the awareness creation with the general public, the technical capacity building for professionals on EEB and the East African Energy Efficiency in Buildings Award, as an instrument to create regional recognition for architects, building owners, real estate developers and other actors that have adopted energy efficiency and green building criteria in their buildings. Component 4: Appropriate Financial Framework for the Promotion of EE Measures in Buildings. This component will focus on EEB finance, following an approach that includes top-level advocacy with the top-managements of commercial banks; training and capacity building on EEB finance; and the introduction of the green mortgage concept in the region. Green\\/EEB investment portfolios will be developed together with the banks. This component will also establish pilot financial mechanisms in all partner countries. Component 5: Development and Implementation of Pilot Projects. This project component will provide technical assistance to all ongoing governmental mass housings projects regarding the incorporation of EEB measures. In partner countries where the EEB code has been approved and adopted, the implementation of the code will be tested in reality and on scale. Operational models will be created for the mainstreaming. An advisory team will provide technical assistance in EEB with respect to planning, design and construction. Important concepts to be promoted will include natural lighting, ventilation and cooling systems; adequate building orientation, the use of sun shading devices; solar water heaters, energy saving lamps etc. The team will also advice on retrofitting existing buildings. The direct GHG emission reductions of this program will be achieved here.It is the projects assumption that the joint implementation of these interlinked components (jointly together with the National Governments and the EAC) in close cooperation with relevant projects by the international donor community will provide sufficient momentum for the achievement of the project objective.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2011-08-15\",\"end-date\":\"2015-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Energy policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2011-08-15\",\"period_end\":\"2015-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2011-08-15\",\"value\":2793000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":1607948,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":1436825,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"BI\",\"percentage\":20},{\"iso2\":\"KE\",\"percentage\":20},{\"iso2\":\"RW\",\"percentage\":20},{\"iso2\":\"TZ\",\"percentage\":20},{\"iso2\":\"UG\",\"percentage\":20}]},\"41120-1795\":{\"title\":\"Water And Sanitation Trust Fund - Contribution From Tillvaxtverket ( Swedish Agency For Economic And Regional Growth)\",\"description\":\"The overarching goal of the project is to improve the health of vulnerable groups, especially young children in Bamako, Ouagadougou and Harar, by introducing environmentally-friendly technologies for water treatment and safe storage at household level\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2011-06-01\",\"end-date\":\"2012-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2011-06-01\",\"period_end\":\"2012-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2011-06-01\",\"value\":74347}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":61456,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":62244,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"ML\",\"percentage\":0}]},\"41120-1799\":{\"title\":\"Identification Of Best Practices, Policies And Enabling Legislation In The Local Delivery Of Basic Urban Services\",\"description\":\"The final goal of this project is to increase access to basic urban services all through further empower local authorities and their associations in the provision of pro-poor urban services through a systematic review and assessment of existing policies and legislation and the degree to which they are being applied to support the attainment of the MDGs.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2011-11-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-02-28\",\"sector\":\"Government administration\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2011-11-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-02-28\",\"value_date\":\"2011-11-01\",\"value\":3404000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":3284309,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":3433797,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":{\"0\":{\"iso2\":\"MZ\",\"percentage\":7},\"1\":{\"iso2\":\"SV\",\"percentage\":9},\"2\":{\"iso2\":\"CO\",\"percentage\":9},\"3\":{\"iso2\":\"ES\",\"percentage\":6},\"5\":{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":10},\"6\":{\"iso2\":\"EC\",\"percentage\":9},\"7\":{\"iso2\":\"BO\",\"percentage\":9}}},\"41120-1800\":{\"title\":\"Monitoring The Mdgs At The Municipal Level In The States Of Rio De Janeiro And Maranhao And Strengthening Local Capacities On Public Policies\",\"description\":\"The overall goal of the project is: to contribute to local sustainable development in 11 municipalities in the State of Rio de Janeiro and 4 municipalities in the State of Maranh\\u00e3o, where large-scale petrochemical industrial activities are being built and will start operation in the near future.

programme\'s purposeis to strengthen the capacity of local, central, and regional institutions andkey stakeholders in settlement and slum improvement through the use of goodgovernance and management approaches, pilot projects, and contributing, whereneeded, to policy development and the implementation of institutional,legislative, financial, and normative and implementation frameworks. To meetthese challenges, the PSUP programme seeks to harmonize with local and nationalstakeholders on key slum upgrading projects through creating a network forregional slum upgrading challenges. For this purpose, regional training andpolicy seminars on the programme\'s concept, themes, and methods will beorganized with all stakeholders involved. The programme also aims to supportlocal and national authorities in identifying adequate funding to carry outspecific activities.Objective 1: To enablenational, city and community representatives and planning authorities to assessurban development needs and urban poverty in ACP countries through applyingcross-sector approaches and building ownership for the urban sector challenges\\u2013 this includes the acknowledgement of informal settlements as an integral partof cities, and with the population therein addressed through a rights-basedapproach.Particularly,municipalities and line ministries responsible for urban development lack humanand financial resources for urban governance and management. Actions in urbanareas lack coordination and often there is duplication of efforts addressingthe same context with very limited resources. Further, apart from strengtheninginstitutions to address urban poverty in an appropriate way, a link betweenfinancing and technical government bodies is essential to finance urban povertyin a sustainable way, also beyond this action.Objective 2: To empowerACP countries national, city and community representatives as well as planningauthorities to address slum dwellers\' needs for better living conditions intheir cities with adequate planning tools and realistic resource mobilizationstrategies \\u2013 addressing and including the slum population directly in designingslum upgrading programmes.Often the identificationof slum upgrading needs lack continuation, implementation and the participationof the target group. The formulation of slum upgrading projects is oftenisolated and sector specific. This often leads to single projects improving livingconditions in the short-term or even leading to conflicts and negative impactson the ground.The capacity to developslum upgrading programmes in an integrated and participatory manner under theleadership of the government and in the context of the whole city or town, withits overall development opportunities, is not taken care off.In addition, policy andregulatory frameworks often hinder sustainable and affordable urbaninfrastructure, land and housing (from plot sizes, land regulations or secure tenureand housing building codes to provision of basic services). This programme aimsat overcoming divides of the informal and formal city and improvement atnational and city or town level.Objective 3: Empowernational, city and community representatives and planning authorities toimplement innovative slum upgrading programmes that demonstrate successful slumupgrading interventions which are to be up-scaled and replicated in othertowns, cities and neighbourhoods and increase visibility.Besides during theimplementation of slum upgrading programmes, not all key stakeholders are awareor involved in the process. This can lead to institutional and communityblockages in cross-sector activities or to the initial target group not fullybenefiting from the action, and if implemented with external experts, the lackof replication and institutional memory.The design andimplementation of slum upgrading activities shall be carried by allstakeholders with their different roles. It shall create job opportunities forthe target group and be enriched through their local knowledge. By having thecross-sector approach, actions and improvements shall multiply their impactthrough feeding into each other. The high visibility and improved capacityshall lead to an up-scaling and replication of activities finding itsreflection in national priorities, budgets and policies beyond this action.In order to achieve thethree major operational objectives in an efficient way, UN-Habitat emphasisesthe importance of a coherent advocacy strategy. This can be strengthened by anenforced tripartite partnership between the European Commission and theEuropean Union Delegations, the ACP Secretariat and UN-Habitat, as well asgovernment (line ministries and finance and planning ministries) to prioritiseand budget for urban development needs and slum upgrading.The PSUP is carried out at local, nationaland regional levels. Local, national and regional programme focal points aretrained on effective and inclusive stakeholder mapping and mobilisation indifferent programme processes. The programme is fully implemented by nationalimplementation partners and overseen by national stakeholders.The stakeholders consist of the following:Local level: local authorities at all levels(both managerial and political), NGOs, CBOs, planning and traininginstitutions, research institutions, academia, the private and informal sector,as well as local slum upgrading initiatives and slum dwellers of identifiedneighbourhoods;National level: relevant ministries,technical departments, offices providing statistics, local governmentassociations, national and international NGOs, CBO representatives, private andinformal sector representatives, academia, and national planning, development andtraining institutions.The PSUP approach aims to build countryteams reflecting both local and national interests. Particular attention willbe given to the selection of implementing agencies in order to provide a higherdegree of capacity-building in relevant institutions and to embed theactivities of the programme in the institutional set-up of respective countries.UN-HABITAT will develop a communication strategy andalso provide the framework of collaboration for an efficient overall programmeexecution and collaboration for undertaking and financing slum upgradingprogrammes in ACP countries.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Housing policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"value\":12965400}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":9237994,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":10812205,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-1904\":{\"title\":\"Youth Empowerment For Urban Development\",\"description\":\"The overall goal of this project is to improve thelivelihoods of young men and women, especially those living in slums andunplanned settlements, through their inclusion in governance and the social andeconomic life of cities, and The overall goal of this project is to improve thelivelihoods of young men and women, especially those living in slums andunplanned settlements, through their inclusion in governance and the social andeconomic life of cities, through giving them access to financial resources, andpublish research-based policy recommendations to decision makers at local,national and international level.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Employment policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"value\":5929699}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":5281916,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":5693982,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-1914\":{\"title\":\"Global Land Tool Network  Phase 2 (Norway Contribution)\",\"description\":\"At present, many countries globally have introduced new land policies, especially in Asia and Africa.Often it is not possible for these countries to implement pro-poor and gender sensitive land policies, because the underlying tools and practices do not exist, or have not been sufficiently documented anddisseminated. Emerging from the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and\\/or customary approaches for their tenure security.An extensive gap analysis was conducted which drew several important conclusions. First, while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and large-scale land tools. Second, a conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to deliver their expectedresults: existing technical solutions are too expensive, inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries, unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in countrycannot be done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination, strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives and continuous dialogues and communicationsbetween and amongst key stakeholders including government (at various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia\\/research institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves.To address these challenges, UN-HABITAT has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of the Global Land Tool Network (now with 45 international partners) aimed at contributing to poverty reduction and to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor since its launch in 2006.GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender sensitive and largescale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the recognition of the need for a \\u2018continuum of land rights\\u2019 to replace the more conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global discourse on key GLTN\\u2019s tools and approaches are well captured by various global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and possible adoption by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Good Governance on Tenure of Land and Natural Resources and recently, wherein UN-HABITAT has played a critical role, the adoption of the African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by recently concluded Third AMCHUD conference and Bamako Action Plan.Moreover, Phase 1 has already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for rolling out with partners at national and local government levels. Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and implement the same on their countrylevelprojects in various countries. Training for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2, the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-HABITAT operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation in targeted countries and\\/or cities\\/municipalities and the needed capacity building initiatives will beundertaken. The Kenya experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with non-state actors has been used as a model for other country\\u2019s interventions by UN-HABITAT (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN partners from theacademia and training institutions are now adopting the land tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) \\u2013 a pro-poor land rights recording system to their Masters\\u2019 Program while the Technical University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training sessions. GLTN\\u2019s partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why goodgrassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated 55,000 slum dwellers.While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known international partners (45) to UN-HABITAT staff and selected landprogrammes\\/projects. It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries and\\/or cities\\/municipalities in partnership with UN-HABITAT\\u2019s field projects and\\/or international partners with their national and local networks, particularly in regard to the agencies new priorityareas of urban land, legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with RTCD and other partners will ensure that in-country interventions will be within the framework of \\u2018One UN System\\u2019 as delivering as one and in accordance with the country\\u2019s Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers (PRSPs) and\\/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor, gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure securityof the urban and rural poor. In this context, there is an urgent need and increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support theadoption and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic partnerships and piloting and working at country level.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2015-12-15\",\"sector\":\"\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2015-12-15\",\"value_date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"value\":2389078}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":3087910,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":3480146,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-1932\":{\"title\":\"Open Un-Habitat Transparency Initiative\",\"description\":\"The purpose of Open UN-Habitat is to gather existing contribution data and documentation from UN-Habitatprojects and make it accessible to the general public.

To address the lack of information amongst planners and decision makers on the key mobility challenges confronting their cities, the project will develop, field-test and disseminate a \\\"RapidAssessment Tool\\\". Quick-Impact field projects will be implemented in 3-4 target cities. These will highlight how simple but innovative intervention such as design of selected streets as shared spaces that fulfill space and linking functions can improve mobility outcome for citizens and businesses. Based on the Project and previous work done by the Urban Basic Services Branch, collaboration will also be sought with the International Financial Institutions, with a view to supporting target cities in securing financing for medium and long-term mobility investments.To achieve and maintain sustainable patterns of mobility, cities require to put in placeappropriate regulatory and institutional arrangements. While \\\"ideal\\\" and \\\"comprehensive\\\" arrangements can take a long time to be established, incremental and quick - impact solutions can again be fruitful - for example a simple GIS based fleet database can make public bus services more efficient in many cities. Based on the results of the Rapid Assessment as mentioned above and through dialogue at the city and national level, this project will support two to three target cities in incrementally adopting a set of new institutional or regulatory arrangements that provide quick and visible benefits to citizens and businesses.The project will benefit all city dwellers, particularly the poor. The commuting public,businesses of all sizes, transport service providers and freight and goods delivery services are amongst the main beneficiary groups who will benefit irom improvements in urban mobility. City dwellers as a whole will indirectly benefit irom improved air quality. Through the use of the Rapid Assessment tool, the project will focus on the mobility challenges faced by women, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.Local Governments of the respective target cities viz Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,Kathmandu, Nepal, Kigali, Rwanda and Vientiane, Lao PDR will be the key partners. The Rapid Assessment tool will be developed through collaboration with a leading international organisation working in the area of urban Mobility. Three potential partners viz. Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), EMBARQ (The World Resources Institute for sustainable Transport) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) have already expressed interest against a call issued by UN-Habitat for this work. Other Knowledge partners may include CODATU (Cooperation for Urban Mobility in the Developing World), U1TP (International Association of Public Transport). Internally, the Urban Basic Services Branch will collaborate closely with other branches, particularly the Urban Planning and Design Branch, The Urban Economy Branch and the Project Office in the implementation of the project.

We have learned through Phases I and II of CCCI that, while primarily concerned about adapting to climate change and building resilience, many local stakeholders also demand the right to be part of the global solution by reducing GHG emissions. This is in part because addressing climate change begins by sensitising local stakeholders about the causes as well as the effects of climate change; this awareness-raising naturally leads to consideration not only of adaptation but also of mitigation actions.Beneficiaries will consist primarily of the residents of cities participating in CCCI, with a focus on the poor living in informal settlements. Adaptation strategies and action plans shall target those vulnerable groups. Mitigation actions will have a broader, more diffuse set of local and global beneficiaries.

(For a list of contributing partners and co-funding, see Section 1.0, above; for further discussion\\/analysis of other stakeholders see Section 2.5 and Annex 3, below.)During Phase III, UN-Habitat will broaden its range of knowledge services, while continuing to offer policy advisory services. As an example of the former type of activity: CCCI experiences will be featured in a special edition ofLocal Environment: The International Journal of Justice and Sustainability, planned for January 2013; eight UN-Habitat staff members have teamed up with 14 other external authors to produce seven articles for this peer-reviewed periodical. As an example of the latter service: in December 2012 CCCI launched its Policy Note series; we will continue this series under CCCI Phase III.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Urban development and management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2012-01-01\",\"value\":2707620}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":2978661,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":3250723,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2023\":{\"title\":\"Prevention, Mediation And Follow-Up Of Land Based Conflicts In Djugu,Mweso And Masisi ( Eastern Drc )\",\"description\":\"- Contribute to pacification of communities by preventing and tackling land dispute in post-conflict settings;- Conditions for IDPs and refugees\' return are in place by establishing land and property restitution and mediation mechanisms to address land disputes and conflicts in North Kivu and Ituri.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-07-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-07-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2012-07-01\",\"value\":425640}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":397192,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":397192,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"CD\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2054\":{\"title\":\"Water And Sanitation Trust Fund (Provision Of Adequate And Safe Drinking Water And Improved Sanitation Services In Mandera County, Kenya\",\"description\":\"Theproposed project wants to address the problem of water supply shortage in thecounty.

The proposal will support the requests of the 3 PICs andothers to concurrently develop and implement their CDSs and SUSs by providingregional (i) institutional strengthening, (ii) knowledge management and (iii)support to strengthen urban policy and project development. It is hoped suchprocesses will lead to (iv) improved monitoring of urban performance by PICsincluding integration of city and national responses to addressing urban issuesvis a vis the PUA and the Pacific Plan. Key outcomes resulting from the abovewill be strengthened national capacity to undertake up scaling of underserviced settlements, an increased number of PICs wanting to undertake CDS andSUS, more national policy makers, planners and training partners interested inaddressing urbanisation issues, and development of a formal mechanism tocapture, share and disseminate knowledge learned. Commitments under the PUAshould also be pursued and monitored. More effective human capacities andstrengthened national and regional institutional structures should result inthe better management of the impacts of urbanization in a sustainable mannerand the improved performance of urban areas. By monitoring and sharing lessonsand knowledge acquired, the CA Regional Support component will add furthervalue to the effectiveness of the CDS and SUS processes being undertaken in the3 selected PICs, including national, city and community levels.

Thiswill emphasize dialogue and dissemination of urban information and knowledgegained. An agreed and accepted regionalinstitutional policy dialogue framework will add value to both regional andnational urban monitoring arrangements as well as implementation of nationalinitiatives such as the CDS and SUS. Regional and national realignment willdemonstrate the importance of urbanisation and the need for timely urbanmanagement responses, including far stronger institutional arrangements such asthe possible development, for example, of a Pacific \\u201cRegional UrbanObservatory\\u201d as well as regional urban management tools. This would form partof a network of National and sub-Regional Urban Observatories planned byUCLG. The benefits of a Pacific RegionalUrban Observatory would be the sharing of information, the provision oftechnical assistance (for example, urban data processing support, examples ofdata use by community organizations, and methods of data analysis), monitoringof regional agreed urban tools such as Pacific Urbanisation Development Goals,the institutionalization of knowledge exchange, the standardization ofindicators and the development of Pacific regional dialogue on indicator use. The scope of this CA Regional Supportproposal also places a strong emphasis on strengthening capacity to documentand analyze knowledge acquired. This includes knowledge creation, sharing anddissemination to promote and support the preparation and implementation oflocal, town, city and national led CDS and SUS, building on lessons learnedfrom Samoa, Fiji and PNG to other PICs. Giventhat a knowledge platform has been established in the Geography Department ofthe University of the South pacific (but is no longer being updated), the CLGFare discussing establishing a Local Government Resource Centre (with websitefor urban issues), and UNESCAP has approved funding to support knowledgemanagement activities under its project \\u201ccapacity-building of SIDS toincorporate the Mauritius Strategy into NSD strategies\\u201d, this regional supportproposal will review where and how best knowledge management frameworks shouldbest be anchored and support development of an urban component to givevisibility and disseminate PUA compliance through best practices, initially onbehalf of PIPA as it receives strengthening support under Component 5, withintended sharing of the urban component to a PIPA website as this develops.PIPA has planning (and lands, surveying, environmentalist professional)membership representation from PIC local and central government, and has beenreceiving modest resource support from AusAID through the Planning Institute ofAustralia (PIA). PIPA provides a network of Pacific planning professionals,often geographically isolated, where they seek to share and obtain informationon current urban development activities and experiences such as squatters,customary land mobilization and informal settlements. Members of PIPA are interested in addressingurban solutions which are seen to be working in pilot projects around thePacific, expanding the number of stakeholders involved (especially developmentpartners), building skills and filling capacity shortages (such as in mediationand negotiation), and strengthening the planning process to which solutionssuch as CDS and SUS must be developed and molded. A key outcome of developing an urbanknowledge management framework will be strengthening of country CA projectimplementation and monitoring and through such monitoring, collation of thedocumentation of the implementation of the 3 country CA proposals. Lessonslearned would be synthesized and through such analysis, UNESCAP will coordinatedevelopment of the Pacific knowledge management framework located in itsPacific Office (EPO), Suva, Fiji, which has been a major supporter of the PUAand its implementation within the region. A Knowledge Management officer wouldbe supported by this proposal, UN-HABITAT and EPO to maintain the collection ofdocuments, an online portal that is linked to other pertinent websites anddisseminate information to ensure accessibility to this information.The knowledge management frameworkwould be focused initially on a website portal with access to documentation, aswell as PIPA coordinated regional workshops for the sharing of lessons,knowledge acquired and implications. This would assist in the process offulfillment of country responsibilities under the PUA and Pacific Plan whilstproviding access to assistance on developing urban work plans, urbanindicators, squatter upgrading, mainstreaming CDS and SUS into NSDPs, access totoolkits and the like. In this context,members of PIPA would become the core capacity building arm for practicingurban planners, managers and decision makers in the Pacific region. PIPA as theregional focal point would ensure that the CDS and SUS principles and practicesas adapted to the Pacific are disseminated and up scaled nationally to members.Working with development partners, the knowledge management framework wouldassist to underpin sustainable urbanization policy dialogue in the region, suchdialogue feeding back into regional policies and plans such as the PacificPlan, as monitored by the SPC. This proposal\'s scope includes assisting SPC to undertakehigh level policy dialogue with PICs so as to institutionalize the PUA, CDS andSUS processes into national urban policy frameworks. A Pacific Ministerial Conference on the \\u2018Stateof Urbanisation in the Pacific\' would be one way to achieve this, to be heldtowards the end of this Regional Support proposal\'s implementation, when thegood practices and lessons learned would be synthesized and visible. As SPC is already working with PICs indeveloping three yearly Joint Country Strategies (JCS), it has already startedto mainstream the PUA, CDS and SUS concepts into these processes. This proposalwill therefore also support SPC to strengthen the monitoring of PUAimplementation and supporting initiatives. The objective is to enable SPC tobecome more effective in its regional reporting and monitoring role of ensuringcommitments under the Pacific Plan (namely, the PUA) are progressed as well asmainstreaming other urban initiatives. To assist SPC in its monitoring role,the possible development of a Pacific Regional Urban Observatory includingdevelopment of a set of Pacific urbanisation Development Goals will beexplored.

It also draws on the fact that much of the innovation and expertise to address water operators\' challenges reside with operators themselves, and that a growing number of these successful operators are highly motivated to share their expertise and innovation with others as \\u201cmentors\\u201d on a not-for-profit basis.The purpose of this programme is to strengthen the capacity of water and sanitation operators to play their full roles in providing sustainable, universal access.GWOPA\'s work is supporting the realization of the Millennium Development Goal Target 7 and the UN General Assembly 2010 Declaration on the Right to Water.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2013-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2017-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2013-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2017-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2013-01-01\",\"value\":7078510}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":3651939,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":4862388,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2108\":{\"title\":\"Immediate Wash Assistance Addressing The Lifesaving Needs Of 6,500 Most Vulnerable Flood Affected Families In Three Districts Of Sindh And Balochistan Provinces Of Pakistan\",\"description\":\"Provision of safe drinking water and life-saving     basic sanitation to flood affected families in an estimated two hundred     spontaneous settlements in Jaffarabad   Naseerabad in Balochistan and     Jacobabad districts in Sindh province;Promotion of safe health and hygiene behaviours to     prevent outbreak of epidemics, with special focus on women and children in     Jaffarabad   Naseerabad in Balochistan and Jacobabad districts in     Sindh province\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-10-16\",\"end-date\":\"2014-04-15\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-10-16\",\"period_end\":\"2014-04-15\",\"value_date\":\"2012-10-16\",\"value\":575000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":522291,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":575000,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"PK\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2123\":{\"title\":\"Support To Benadir Regional Administration\'s Central Department Of Urban Planning\",\"description\":\"The central purpose of the project is the establishment of an effective Department of Urban Planning that is able to start to plan, co-ordinate and prioritize urban redevelopment.The project will contribute to re-establishing a core institution and establish the groundwork for a much larger programme.

Amidst armed conflict, UN-Habitat has continued to serve the people of Afghanistan without interruption for the past 20 years. One of the major fall outs for the armed-conflict is the erosion of community institutions. The conflict has increased the share of the number of people living in deprivation and has also eroded the social fabric people used to rely on during crisis. Even during the difficult period of Taliban rule, the community development approach flourished in spite of tremendous odds. The institutional manifestation of this approach was the Community Forum (CF) and CDCs that participating communities formed themselves. In many ways, the CF\\/CDCs became the institutional platform for local people to exercise their right and responsibilities, and at the same time embrace good governance when there was not legitimate government.The UN-Habitat\'s community empowerment approach that emerged in the course of more than a decade of working with Afghan communities builds on this same spirit. The approach has now become a flagship programme of the Government National Solidarity Programme. For the rehabilitation process, UN-Habitat not only focuses on the physical reconstruction, but also building social capital of the communities. It is necessary to provide meaningful support for community engagement so that the process results into empowered community institutions, that have opportunities to address their most pressing priorities.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-07-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-07-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2012-07-01\",\"value\":1545600}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":872818,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":826540,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"AF\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2127\":{\"title\":\"Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (Huwsup)\",\"description\":\"The overall objective of the project is to improve access to safe and affordable water and enhance livelihoods of vulnerable households in urban and peri-urban areas of Hargeisa city, through expanded supply of drinking water from sustainable water sources, and associated creation of employment opportunities.The project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). The specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: i. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; ii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and iii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.The overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. As requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. While the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan\'s Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:ii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfieldiii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency\'s core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. iv.

Initiatives focused in these areas comprise the underlying purpose of I-PSM Phase II. The programme seeks to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework and processes of national and local governance to enhance service delivery. Particular focus will ensure that sector service delivery efforts and corresponding human rights are universal where they can be (health, education and water supply and sanitation) and targeted to the poorest of the poor wherever possible. The programme adopts participatory approaches and aims to re-train and restructure ministries and governorate offices, Iraqi citizens will have a clear understanding of the structures and processes in government, its decision-making, and how they can participate in these processes. I-PSM Phase II responds to the findings, lessons learned and recommendations of Phase I. The programme is designed with a holistic approach to governance reforms, capacity development and sector modernisation.The proposed intervention addresses the need of carrying out a long term, comprehensive and whole of government reforms at national and sub national levels focused on improving service delivery to the citizens in the three sectors of education, health and WATSAN. In Phase I (2010-2012), functional reviews of these sectors were carried out jointly by the concerned Ministries of GoI and UN agencies. UN agencies provided technical assistance in preparing the road map and costed service delivery models of the three sectors. Phase II will support the GoI in implementing the roadmaps prepared in Phase I. Besides the reform initiatives planned for the whole of the government in Iraq, KRG has agreed to undertake a comprehensive civil service reforms for the Region.The Programme has four themes: i) Developing institutional arrangements and the distribution of roles, authority and decision-making mechanisms; ii) Piloting reform in three key sectors: health; education; and water and sanitation (WATSAN), focusing on (1) modern  institutional arrangements (with requisite laws, legislations, regulations and plans, policies and strategies( (2) Public Private Partnership (3) Cost-effective fiscal management and (4) Modern human resources management methods; iii) Supporting system-wide reform for gender mainstreaming, e-governance, national statistics and development management; and iv) Supporting decentralised service delivery and local governance initiatives, particularly focusing on development of tools for social participation.UN-Habitat\'s expertise and background in service delivery, particularly in the field of water and sanitation, its ongoing relationship with the MMPW, and its knowledge of effective modes of decentralization are key reasons for UN-Habitat\'s participation in the overall programme.  UN-Habitat will focus on programme outputs relating to assisting the GoI in developing reform and modernization plans for the Water and Sanitation Sector, as well as improving decentralized service delivery in target sectors \\u2013 with enhanced local governance and participation.  UN-Habitat in partnership with UNICEF will support reforms to water and sanitation sector through implementation of sector specific modernisation plans and capacity development programmes, as per the agreed roadmaps of I-PSM Phase I by the relevant line ministries, and in the KRG (upstream and downstream reform). This intervention aims directly at improving service quality through development of service delivery models, developing operational arrangements for utility, focusing on rationalized use and use practices as well as developing a medium-term fiscal framework to be a link between the policy making process, priorities and budget. Furthermore, UN-Habitat in partnership with the other UN agencies will provide support to strengthen the local governance institutions at the provincial and city-level, promote participatory processes, improve urban governance and support decentralised service delivery, including fiscal decentralisation (downstream reform).

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS\\/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. The project will address three aspects:i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as \\u201cPromoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa\\u201d which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects\\/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services. Many conventional products and services are not only unsustainable but uneconomical, and yet people are still relying on those mainly in the absence of consumer awareness.

UNFPA has also provided GSO with support for capacity building to GSO\'s statisticians to conducting the national-wide 2009 Census on Population and Housing, and conducted the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) in close cooperation with United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF).In the period 2012 - 2016, UNFPA will continue to provide technical support in the production and dissemination of quality population data that will be used for policy researches and studies, planning, monitoring and evaluation of social and population strategies mainly at the national and regional levels, as well as assessing the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) committed to by the Government of Viet Nam. Almost all of technical support to date primarily focuses on population variables and the socio-economic sector in general. As the result, there is still a lack of statistical data and information that are in great need for urban development planning and long-term city socio-economic development strategies (CDS). UNFPA is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV\\/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect.With its rich experience in providing support for countries on population and development, UNFPA is an important partner providing technical assistance to MPI (through GSO) in producing and disseminating population statistics information and data for evidence based policy development and monitoring of the implementation of socio-economic development plans.Engaging in this project, UNFPA can provide statisticians and selected officers of MPI and government agencies at different levels with technical support to build capacity and skills in producing and publishing data of national surveys as well as studies on specific emerging issues, sharing international experience, analyzing policies, improving capacity in monitoring policy implementation towards the implementation of Plan of Actions of International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and MDGs.UNFPA\'s comparative advantages are compatible with the action plans of GSO implementing VSDS 2011-2020; integrating population dynamics into development planning, and study on impact of the relationship between population and development to provide evidence for the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2011-2020 at national and local levels. In the years to come, UNFPA plans to continue providing technical support for integrating population variables into socio-economic development plans. With the profession in various areas of statistical work, including the training programmes for statisticians at different levels, UNFPA have and continue making a significant contribution to strengthening the statistical system for population variables. It would also benefit UN-Habitat for strengthening urban statistical data and information through making use of the established system and more skillful human resources through working in partnership with UNFPA for the project on \\u201cSupport for the implementation of the Vietnam Statistical Development Strategy in the period 2011-2020 It will be therefore strategic to provide MPI through GSO with technical support in coordination with UNFPA as it would basically enable UN-Habitat to make best use of the cadre of statisticians who have been and being trained by UNFPA under the 5-year project jointly supported by UN-Habitat and UNFPA, and the statistical systems already set up and operating for several years. More importantly, when being a part of the national statistics systems, urban statistics data and information will formally have the legal effect that would be in great need for government policy makers and planning professionals as they need for formalized sources of data and information. In consideration of the limited amount each UN agency may apply for from the One Plan Fund for September 2012 allocation round, this proposed proposal is developed to cover the first year\'s planned activities of the 5-year Project 2012 \\u2013 2016 entitled \\u201cSupport for the implementation of the Vietnam Statistics Development Strategy in the period 2011-2020 and utilization of population information in development planning and programming\\u201d jointly developed by UN-Habitat and UNFPA and has been formally approved by the Government of Vietnam under ONE PLAN 2012 \\u2013 2016 (reference to Annex 3- Official Letter No. 1026\\/TTg-QHQT dated 19 July 2012 of the Prime Minister to approve the project).

It is an initiative that providescollaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.Specifically,it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a moreholistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge todeploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity pathwill be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow andlopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. Therationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization ofprosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies thatthreaten rather than enhance sustainability.Byestimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globallycomparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for trackingprogress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations incities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspondto locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiativewill enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoringof urban prosperity.Three intermediate accomplishments of the CitiesProsperity Initiative will be:Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and     future progress towards the prosperity path.At a more local level, the CitiesProsperity Initiative aims at:Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and     project viability for financing.The benefits of engagement arising from theTechnical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative arecaptured in the table below.

Evaluating  efforts and processes deployed to advance prosperity         Lessons Learned     Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:1.Cities createconditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity2.Cities beginto implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on atailored General Action Plan and related Road Map3.Cities arecapable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity pathTheCity Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel ofProsperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policyinterventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package describedabove. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrumof areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperitypath in a more sustainable manner. UN-Habitat\'swheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the fivedimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in theCity Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmittedthrough the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hubthe local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring theprevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling thedirection, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development ofthe five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.Thehub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations andinstitutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, specialagencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hubrepresents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematicfocus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat\'sthematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization ofthe Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat giventhe direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of UrbanProsperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity andenvironmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat\'s thematicBranches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat\'s Brancheswill be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities toprepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriateinnovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitateoperationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technicaladvisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanismsto track progress on a path of prosperity. Inaddition, UN-Habitat\'s regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers willplay a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities ProsperityInitiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtainedfrom the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of threeconsultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and LatinAmerica is already underway.Anumber of external partners will also play a critical role in the realizationof the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local andmetropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regionalacademic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks andHabitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitatwill rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing datafor the estimation of CPIs.

So far, implementation of the DDPD has been slower and less complete than envisaged, placing strain on the mechanisms of the agreement. For example, the absence of local social services despite best efforts continues to be a challenge and is increasing frustrations. Even so, the framework created by the DDP provides a unique window of opportunity to engage in \\u2018business unusual\'.Efforts have been made to settle conflicts arising from transhumance routes. In 1989 in North Darfur the governor together with local councils and the Native Administration reached an agreement on the rules governing transhumance routes. The North Darfur State Transhumance Act in 1991 enshrined these principles. The Act has been followed by many conferences and workshops, but has remained ineffective due to inadequate involvement by the pastorals and farmers, and the weakness of the Native Administration. A national high committee on transhumance was established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in 1997 to prepare a comprehensive study of livestock corridors, where a Livestock Corridors Act was promulgated by the governor in 1998. The Act defines livestock routes, different categories of pasture and water points, lists activities not allowed on stock routes including farming, burning, cutting of trees, building and harvesting of fodder, and fixes penalties. A conflict resolution committee is created with membership from the administration including the police, and the native administration. There are no herder or farmer representatives. The general opinion is that the lack of real contact with the grass roots makes this committee ineffective. Transhumance routes remain a key issue for the project. Useful lessons learned through implementation of Sudan Peace Building and Development Project SPDP have been taken into consideration when designing this Project Proposal, which aims to make contributions towards the following areas:Better management of natural resources, within and between local communities, and between communities and the stateLegal and policy reform, to clarify the formal framework within which rural land uses take place and conflicts are settled;Institutional reform for improved natural resource management, including support to creation of an effective local administration which incorporates elements of the customary system reflected by the Native Administration, and capacity building in both government and civil society;More comprehensive natural resource management strategies and plans, which recognize the important economic role played by pastorals without neglecting farming and adopt planning concepts and approaches relevant to and supportive of pastoral livelihoods;Strengthened and more democratic representative bodies for pastorals and farmers, so that their interests are better defended in public debate and decision-makingLocal pastoral and farming communities in Greater Darfur, especially those affected and are currently exposed to conflicts, who are often among the poorest.

According to statistics of IOM from October 2012, the number of returnees between October 2010 and October 2012 in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria was 197,027 with continued new arrivals every day. A fast horizontal sprawling of state capitals and major towns is observed, with low income groups settling in urban and peri-urban areas and provoking slum formation. The debate in South Sudan is whether it is better for the returnees to go back to their original villages where they can access land for agriculture, or to settle in urban areas where they can access basic services and job opportunities. Although it is understood that returnees should make their choice freely, humanitarian organisations should not forget the high social cost of recent mass evictions and demolition campaigns in informal urban areas nor underestimate the critical importance of designing long term spatial development mechanisms and capacities in the short term to prevent potential conflict and to contribute to peace stabilisation. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed to ensure a more sustainable returnee reintegration process and prevent slum formation through application of provision of adequate housing conditions and basic services, establishment of livelihood options for returnees and equitable and planned land allocation. It is suggested to start working in the states with high numbers of returnees to build basic institutional capacities through on-the-job training and implementation of demonstration activities. While targeted direct beneficiaries of this project are returnees and host communities, the main project counterparts of UN-Habitat will be the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP) of the government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the Ministries of Physical Infrastructure (MoPIs) of the three targeted states.Through this initiative UN-Habitat will provide adequate housing conditions and basic community infrastructure through participatory approach and on-the-job institutional capacity building, set an example and develop strategies for national housing delivery and urban planning for replication and scaling up and promote the use of low-cost and environmental-friendly construction techniques which can also sustain livelihoods and support urban and regional planning and land management. This will be done in close coordination with GoSS as well as other UN agencies and international bi\\/multilateral partners working on return and reintegration issues.Although construction of permanent housing, support to sustainable livelihood and planning are often considered to be development activities, in context of South Sudan, where thousands have already returned and need support to settle and re-integrate in existing urban areas, quickly for sake of human security and prevention of new conflicts in this still very vulnerable country which has its internal issues with negative potentials, this project has a clear emergency character. The project is designed for a quick and measurable impact: provide houses, support livelihoods and reintegration within host communities in a planned manner.

The proposed action would improve the current status of social service delivery in the rural communities. Target beneficiaries of the project are the host communities living along the right side of Turkhum Express way. The project is estimated to benefit the 8,330 families; including, 22,740 women, 23,908 men, 5,248 girls and 6,414 boys of 23 villages of Tehsil Jamrod town II. Target area has been identified in consultation with the FATA Secretariat and the government line departments. Target villages include: Gador, Hajin \\u2013 o \\u2013 Killi, Gafor Killi, Sorkamar, Bogyyary, Naway Abadi II, Kaper Tangi, Walo Mila, Ghariza, Malikabad, New Abadi, Gull Rahman Killi, Haji Sardar Killi, Samar Bahag, Chanar Killi, Saferabad, Bagh, Ayo Srongona, Parank Killi, Karkoshta, Ali Masijid and Prank Sam.The project will specifically address the needs of vulnerable groups of the targeted area. PRA tools will be applied to identify and prioritize community needs. Walkthrough surveys, focus group discussion (FGDs) will be conducted in the selected villages to facilitate the need identification and prioritization which will be followed by development of community action plan (CAP) by the communities. Identified and prioritize needs will be reviewed by UN-Habitat in conjunction with scope of the project and UN-Habitat\'s mandate. The project will be carried out in partnership with Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and in close collaboration with FATA Secretariat and Planning and Development Department of KP Government. UN-Habitat will provide advisory services on DRM and urban issues to the government and other project stakeholders. UN-Habitat\'s mandate will be addressed through the development of project proposal and award of community contracts. This project will also deal with urbanization issues of district Peshawar and its small towns.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-12-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-06-30\",\"sector\":\"Housing policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-12-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-06-30\",\"value_date\":\"2012-12-01\",\"value\":963000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":1026630,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":1018000,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"PK\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2295\":{\"title\":\"Project For Rehabilitation Of Community Infrastructure And Facilities In The Conflict Affected Areas In Northern Provinces In Sri Lanka\",\"description\":\"The overall objective of the project is to contribute to sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction of conflict affected Northern Sri Lanka.

While reasonably effective for specific threats, this approach is largely palliative, i.e. defining risk, and retro-fitting remedial measures to reduce it. However, there is no means to test the efficacy of these remedial efforts until another disaster occurs that meets or exceeds the original design limits.Many urban risk reduction initiatives address specific hazards. These are usually well-known (or at least well-publicized), and more recently since the \\u2018climate change agenda\' has become a global, well-funded, and extremely well-articulated agenda including city strategies to cope with a range of climate-driven threats and mitigating their impact on the global climate. However, approaches often ignore other hazards including the largest killers such as earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as automobile accidents, fires and industrial or technological disasters, and social and political crisis.The closest approximation of a tool for building resilience is the UN-ISDR\'s 10 point checklist associated with their Making Cities Resilient (MCR) global Campaign. However, recent testing of this framework reveals its primary weaknesses which derive from a framework of principles that are self-assessed by local governments, and self-driven with no clear standards that planners, engineers, architects, economists, and other experts who manage cities can target and use. The results are qualitative in nature, and while clearly a good foundation for advocating the resilience agenda globally, will demand further strategies and tools to ensure cities actually do become measurably more resilient.While some developments focusing on multi-hazard approaches, such as the one above, are emerging, to date there is no system for defining forward-looking, integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder urban systems approach to planning and developing urban settlements capacity to withstand and recover from crisis, i.e. achieving measurable resilience.The URIP fills a significant sustainable development planning and implementation gap at a time when cities are assuming ever-increasing local, regional, national and global socio-economic significance.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2012-06-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-06-30\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2012-06-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-06-30\",\"value_date\":\"2012-06-01\",\"value\":1539060}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":511878,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":526345,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2318\":{\"title\":\"Xi\'an Chanba Ecology Zone Sustainable Development Project\",\"description\":\"The purpose of the project is to lay the foundation for longer term sustainable urban development in the Xi\'an Chanba Ecology Zone, by setting a vision and principles for future management, communication adn citizen participation.

The NSP aims to empower Afghans to build solidarity, reduce poverty through establishing and strengthening a national network of self-governing community institutions. The flexible and responsive design of the NSP has allowed it to be a main conduit of central government\'s poverty reduction and reconstruction policies, enabling local people to actively participate in local governance and development through the formation of CDCs. As a result, rural people of Afghanistan are able to build on a shared vision, and values, and democratically-decided priorities to create a healthy and sustainable nation. NSP fosters public trust in governance, enhances unity, equity and justice with communities democratically electing their own councils to engage in important local decisions and deciding how to distribute resources to address their development priorities. The concept of the NSP is based on the provision of block grants directly provided by the government to communities for rural infrastructure projects. Each community elects their representatives to form the CDC, the main decision-making body at the local level. In order to avoid a situation where candidates get threatened or run for the competition out of fear of local power holders, the elections follow a \\u201cno-candidate\\u201d rule. They would be valid only if at least 60% of the community members participate in elections, thus requiring the participation of women. The CDC is the main interlocutor of the government and other development actors. It designates members who are responsible for financial management, including opening of a bank account in the name of the community. In addition, the CDC can establish specific sub-committees responsible for procurement, implementation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation.The NSP consists of four core elements:\\u00b7 Facilitation at the community level to assist communities to further strengthen inclusive CDCs through secret ballot and democratic (re)elections; reach consensus on priorities and corresponding subproject activities; develop eligible subproject proposals that comply with NSP appraisal criteria; and implement approved subprojects;\\u00b7 Building capacity of CDCs and community members (both men and women) in participation, consensus-building, accounting, procurement and contract management, operations and maintenance, and monitoring;\\u00b7 Providing direct block grant transfers to fund approved subprojects; and\\u00b7 Linking CDCs to government agencies, NGOs, and donors to improve access to services and resources.Target Groups: The primary beneficiaries are the villagers (both men and women), including the poor and the vulnerable groups, who through a participatory planning process, select sub-projects that addresses their needs for local reconstruction and development. Empowerment of rural population is achieved through participatory planning, local reconstruction and development leading to improved livelihoods and access to services benefiting both men and women.Based on the principles of inclusion and equity, NSP ensures inclusion of women and vulnerable groups (such as ethnic\\/tribal minority groups, elderly, IDPs, returnees, refugees) to ensure that these groups are included in decision-making processes and that their concerns are fully addressed.A total of 956 communities of twelve districts in seven provinces, as given in Table below, will benefit from empowerment through participating in CDC activities and access to improved infrastructure and services.

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS\\/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. The project will address three aspects:i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as \\u201cPromoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa\\u201d which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects\\/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services. Many conventional products and services are not only unsustainable but uneconomical, and yet people are still relying on those mainly in the absence of consumer awareness.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2013-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2015-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Multisector aid for basic social services\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2013-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2015-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2013-01-01\",\"value\":1121035}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":663740,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":715393,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}]},\"41120-2346\":{\"title\":\"State Of Colombian Cities Report\",\"description\":\"El prop\\u00f3sito de este proyecto es el de generar el Primer Reporte Nacional sobre el Estado de las Ciudades Colombianas , que presente la situaci\\u00f3n actual de las mismas y que analice las tendencias generales de urbanizaci\\u00f3n y de desarrollo regional en los \\u00faltimos a\\u00f1os, mediante la sistematizaci\\u00f3n de nuevos datos, indicadores urbanos e \\u00edndices, empleando las t\\u00e9cnicas y m\\u00e9todos de an\\u00e1lisis m\\u00e1s actualizados, utilizando un marco te\\u00f3rico y de pol\\u00edtica mundialmente reconocido y aprobado como es el \\u00cdndice de Prosperidad de las Ciudades de ONU-Habitat.Este proyecto responde a la necesidad de contar con indicadores m\\u00e1s precisos y actuales sobre el estado de las ciudades y los factores que influyen en el desarrollo de las mismas.

This integrated approach will develop the greatest synergies, which will be for the benefit of all participating cities SOLUTIONS will link to and build upon. Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America have developed a wide range of innovative sustainable mobility solutions, technologies and innovations and the SOLUTIONS project will bring these experiences together and will facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing, foster uptake and innovation transfer and support future targeted cooperation. SOLUTIONS will achieve this, by using a four-step approach[TS1], which also mirrors the work package structure of the project. An initial transferability assessment of research and technology and innovation supported in past or on-going EU funded collaborative research and cooperation projects will summarize the existing knowledge on state of art innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions and experience with their transferability to different local and regional contexts. This will be complemented by experience and solutions (technologies and best practices in each context) from leading cities from Europe, China and Latin America and from Singapore. The first set of agreed guidelines for transferability will be a key input to the knowledge sharing and capacity building platform, which will be the second step towards the promotion of take-up of sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions. These two steps will have cross-links with the global dialogue and will provide the opportunity to work with cities that are capable and motivated to take the next step towards implementation: the needs assessment and the feasibility studies for Asian and Latin American cities or the needs assessment and development of recommendations for the Mediterranean. The experiences from these cities will then feed back into transferability (technology, practices) guidelines, which will later provide a comprehensive \\u201chandbook\\u201d of experience with selected innovative sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions around the world. The results that will be obtained will be promoted widely in the partner regions and globally to accelerate the deployment of innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions in cities in Europe and around the world.While SOLUTIONS will build strongly on previous and on-going projects and coordination initiatives, as is the nature of a coordinating action, it also aims to provide added value that goes beyond summarising and facilitating knowledge sharing and research and technology transfer. SOLUTIONS aims to bridge the \\u201cimplementation gap\\u201d between the potentials of innovative sustainable mobility and transport solutions and packages of solutions and the actual level of uptake and quality of the deployment and implementation mechanisms.Through its outlined objectives, the SOLUTIONS project will specifically address the problem of a lack of broad regional up-take of innovative urban mobility solutions which have been successful particularly in Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. The core target group for the SOLUTIONS project are cities, for which the project has three categories to support the take-up of sustainable urban mobility solutions:Leading CitiesLeading Cities from Europe, China, Latin America, and Singapore, can share their expertise in the development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility solutions. They will also benefit from the mutual learning process and the knowledge sharing with other cities in the world.Take-up CitiesThe feasibility studies developed in WP3 will be a concrete step toward implementation of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions in Asia and Latin America and provides showcases for other cities around the world.Learning CitiesThe trainings offered in WP2 and the transferability guidelines will provide active support for cities to implement sustainable urban mobility solutions and the knowledge sharing and dialogue will inform the identification of future research needs.The regions addressed in this project present different levels of maturity in terms of experience with sustainable urban mobility related actions.Four SOLUTIONS regions with different approaches:Europe: Leading Cities in development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility Asia: Regions of particular interest: electromobility, public transport and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Latin America: Regions of particular interest: Bus Rapid Transit and modal integration in public transport Mediterranean: Knowledge sharing and identification of future research needs, focus on: Public Transport, Transport infrastructure, City logistics and Integrated planning\\/SUMPsUsing the above regions and allocated approaches, the SOLUTIONS project aims to deploy innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges.The principle tools for achieving this are:Identify key innovations, examine transferability, webinars Feasibility studies, knowledge sharing, developing projects Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europa, Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean International conference, fostering thematic dialogues, capacity building, recommendations for future cooperation Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries Knowledge exchange, policy recommendations, research cooperationAn overview of the approach to address the Problem encompassing all work-package elements is described below: 1. Deployment of innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges thorough a review and assessment of existing innovative transport solutions in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Innovative transport solutions that have been successfully implemented mainly in Europe but also in Asia and Latin America, leading to significant benefits for various stakeholders, will be identified and thoroughly analysed, utilizing the past experience of the project partners and of the network of associated entities on relevant initiatives. In addition to focusing on European innovations, innovative transport solutions implemented in Asia and Latin America will be also assessed in terms of their applicability to European cities.Transferability analysis The innovative transport solutions from Europe, Asia and Latin America will be analysed in detail assessing their transferability potential to cities located in the target world regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America and Mediterranean) (WP 1). The analysis will take into account specific socio-economic, environmental and political conditions in the target regions enabling the summary of the key characteristics of cities in those regions. Therefore, for each measure or package of measures, the specific context and settings that must apply for their successful transferability will be identified and compared to the existing conditions in the partner regions enabling the identification of the specific steps that need to be taken towards their successful adoption by the local stakeholders in each case. A collection of transferable policies and measures for each region will be effectively disseminated.Providing information on success factors and barriers to existing innovative transport solutions Utilizing past experience derived from the successful application of innovative transport solutions in Europe, the transferability analysis will identify success factors as well as barriers for their take-up and implementation (WP 1). Guidance on the implementation processes will be provided with examples from Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. SOLUTIONS thus will support cities throughout the process of selecting and implementing new transport solutions avoiding in that way any potential mistakes and accelerating decision-making. Knowledge sharing on transferable innovative transport solutions Results of the detailed analysis of the innovative transport solutions will be disseminated in the form of publications and through regional workshops in the Mediterranean, Asia and Latin America (WP 2). Knowledge sharing regarding the identified new transport solutions is the first important step towards a broader deployment of these innovative approaches. SOLUTIONS will provide take-up candidates with fast and easy access regarding the implementation experiences derived from European cases, thus accelerating implementation in other cities.Feasibility studies in Asian and Latin American partner citiesSOLUTIONS will go beyond the theoretical analysis of the best practices, by testing the feasibility of selected innovative transport solutions in four showcase cities (WP 3). The feasibility studies will assess whether the proposed measures are feasible within the existing policy environment, technically and financially. The feasibility studies will ensure that partner cities can identify and select measures that are the most suitable for their local conditions maximizing their potential impact and leading to significant benefits. To this end, the feasibility of selected approaches proves to be an additional key step towards the successful deployment of new transport solutions. The outcome of the feasibility study will be a validated transport solution that can be successfully implemented by the city representatives. Attractive transport solutions for cities in Asia and Latin AmericaTo meet the specific needs of different cities; the participating cities will be asked to indicate the innovative transport solutions they are interested in. The outcomes of the initial transferability analysis will enable the partner cities to select measures that are desirable from their perspective (WP 3) within a specific thematic cluster or cross cutting among several clusters. Developing targeted projects SOLUTIONS will prepare the deployment of innovative transport solutions up to the initiation of the actual implementation process. For four cities two in each of Asia and Latin America, detailed policy recommendations and targeted projects will be developed based on the feasibility studies (WP 3). The costs and benefits of selected measures will be assessed and specific project proposals will be developed including recommendations on possible sources of funding such as climate finance options, etc. Dissemination of the knowledge gained regarding the transferability of innovative green transport solutionsThe experiences shared in cooperation with the partner cities will provide significant input in the form of specific guidelines that will support interested cities throughout the deployment of innovative green transport solutions worldwide. Thereby, the local deployment of selected solutions in the partner cities will act as a role model for deployment worldwide. In this process the consortium members will play an important role as multipliers.Guidelines for assessing the transferability of innovative transport solutions and for conducting feasibility studies will be developed and disseminated using the broad network of the consortium members (WP 1 \\/ WP 2 \\/ WP 4 \\/ WP 5). The guidelines will include easy-to-use tools that can be easily applied by policy practitioners in emerging countries. Furthermore, finance guidelines and guidelines on institutions and governance will be compiled and disseminated to assist practitioners in the implementation process. 2. Transfer of innovative transport solutions promoted by European industry to other regions of the worldIdentifying key transport innovations developed by European companies and testing their transferabilityThe transferability guidelines will include two aspects policy innovation and technology solutions promoted by European industry. SOLUTIONS will outline the potential of innovative technology solutions and define ways to integrate them into existing systems and structures (WP 1). Providing information on the transferability of innovative transport solutionsSOLUTIONS will analyse different transport solutions with regard to their transferability to specific regional conditions around the world (WP 1). The analysis will also include transport solutions that are based on products of European industry. Conditions under which the specific measure or package of measures can be applied with a comparable degree of success elsewhere will be identified. Issues affecting the implementation process or the outcomes of the measures such as legal and political frameworks, public acceptance, enforcement and technological requirements will be analysed. Necessary adjustments to the measures will be identified and fed back to European industry, thus ensuring their applicability in other regions. Webinars providing information on solutions promoted by European industryA series of webinars will be offered to cities in the target regions as well as to officials from cities around the world (WP 2). During the webinars, information on innovative green transport solutions promoted by European industry will be provided broadening their visibility in several cities worldwide.3. Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europe, Asia, Latin America and the MediterraneanInternational conference with participants from all regionsAll participants (project partners and network of associated entities) from Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe will come together in an international conference to discuss available transport solutions and existing experiences (WP 2). Side events at major international conferences As part of the project, side events at major international conferences such as the World Urban Forum, UN-Habitat Governing Council and the International Transport Forum will be organised (WP 5). During these side events, policy makers, practitioners and international experts will have the opportunity to discuss transport innovation and while first results of the transferability analysis will be presented. Fostering thematic dialogues Policy makers, practitioners and experts from various thematic clusters will come together in order to discuss transport innovations in the field of policy technology and infrastructure as well as further on-going research. The project consortium will bring together policy experts, transferability experts, feasibility experts and implementation partners facilitating their fruitful dialogue. The dialogue will be encouraged by face-to-face meetings in the form of three workshops taking place in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2 \\/ WP 5). Eight to twelve cities per region are expected to participate in those workshops and be closely involved in the thematic dialogues. Close cooperation between local practitioners from different regions \\u2013 Mutual learningSOLUTIONS will bring together local practitioners and policy makers from different regions across the world (WP 3 \\/ WP 4), establishing close cooperation and an efficient knowledge transfer channel between cities that have successfully implemented transport innovations and cities that are interested in adopting a similar approach. Thereby, SOLUTIONS will strengthen the links between local authorities in Europe and in other industrialised or emerging countries while the process of mutual learning will further support global dialogue.Capacity building The knowledge gained through SOLUTIONS regarding innovative green transport solutions and their transferability, will greatly support existing workshops and training programmes in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2). Those events will provide the opportunity to local practitioners to be efficiently trained regarding the transferability and feasibility analysis of transport solutions and be informed in detail about implementation examples in Europe and\\/or the partner countries. Online exchange platform, information gateway and materialsA public SOLUTIONS website will be developed. The website will be the main tool for communication and exchange of information. It will act as the promotional portal for SOLUTIONS and will offer tailored information for the different target groups. The website will be structured to provide easily accessible information for practitioners, city officials, national governments or ministries and international organisations. The website will foster cross regional knowledge sharing and dialogue not only within one target group, but its design is intended to trigger discussions across the various groups of stakeholders. The website will be promoted through an online newsletter that will be spread with the help of the networking and dissemination partners. SOLUTIONS will also use social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter to stimulate a global dialogue on innovative transport solutions and to facilitate exchange. Multiplier workshopsKey results of SOLUTIONS will be presented at multiplier workshops. The workshops will raise the profile of the SOLUTIONS projects and will promote the innovative solutions that have been assessed. Moreover, the workshops will bring together stakeholders from various regions and will trigger a discussion about innovative solutions. The workshops will be linked to related events and conferences and each will be carried out in a different region to optimise outreach. Developing recommendations for future cooperation Based on the experience gained during the course of the project, detailed recommendations for future cooperation between the focus regions, with regard to transport solutions, will be developed. The experiences gained and the research gaps identified during the transferability and feasibility studies as well as the initial implementation efforts will foster the development of a future research cooperation agenda for Asia and Latin America (WP 3) as well as for the Mediterranean (WP 4).4. Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countriesKnowledge exchange on innovative green transport solutionsMutual exchange of experience on innovative green urban transport solutions will be fostered through workshops, the international conference and additional bilateral meetings that will be organized (WP 2 \\/ WP 5). During these events researchers will identify those solutions of interest to specific areas and will set the agenda for further investigating them and evaluating their potential within the context of local conditions. Analysis of the current situation in the MediterraneanSOLUTIONS will analyse the current situation of the transport system in Mediterranean cities (several city and national authorities from the region have provided Letters of Support) as well as the framework conditions prevailing there (WP 4). The assessment of local conditions in each city will enable the identification of those solutions fitting best local needs and presenting the highest transferability potential. Furthermore, current gaps in Mediterranean urban transport systems as well as related research gaps will be identified.Formulation of policy recommendationsBases on the gap analysis, policy recommendations for Mediterranean cities will be formulated (WP 4). During the transferability studies, innovative transport solutions will be tested with regard to their transferability to the specific conditions existing on Mediterranean cities. As a result, a set of measures that are transferable to Mediterranean cities will be included in the policy recommendations. Mediterranean urban mobility research networkSOLUTIONS will foster the development of a Euro-Mediterranean urban mobility research network (WP 4). The network will be developed based on the vast number of activities carried out in SOLUTIONS that enable face-to-face encounters between researchers and practitioners. Development of a research cooperation agenda for the MediterraneanSOLUTIONS will develop a research cooperation agenda on sustainable urban transport. The research agenda will be based on the identified research gaps (WP 4). As the agenda will build on discussions with researchers and local stakeholders during SOLUTIONS, it is ensured that it includes the actual needs of local practitioners. In addition, the research agenda outlines opportunities for initiating future research cooperation between Europe and other Mediterranean countriesInternal and External Implementing Partners:In the consortium, SOLUTIONS brings together the key city and transport and technology research organisation networks in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Mediterranean (ICLEI, EMBARQ, Polis, FEHRL, CAI and ECTRI). The close cooperation between the consortium partners and the member cities and research organisation within these networks, offers already an extensive set of potential stakeholders who are very interested in participating in the SOLUTIONS global dialogue. As a core value of the consortium, the intention is to reach out as well as possible to all interested parties in urban mobility and transport solutions fostering targeted research and innovation cooperation at a global scale. All consortium partners are fully committed to the proposed tasks and each partner takes tasks in the work packages that play a role to its strength and particular working expertise. All consortium partners have proven experience and a particular expertise profile. Most partners have a successful history of collaboration in the already mentioned preceding projects and have high confidence and trust in each other. All consortium partners have a strong commitment to work together, to deliver high quality deliverables and excellent outcome in time, and to fully engage into all dissemination and outreach activities.Associated partnersBeyond the vast networks of the SOLUTIONS project consortium a large number or cities, research organisations, universities, NGOs, international organisations and government bodies have shown an interest in the SOLUTIONS project and are willing to contribute to its success. A number of local and national authorities have expressed their interest to be involved in the project either as Leading-City or as individual City-Expert. Several cities from China, India and Latin America have indicated that they would consider being part of the project and participating as Take-up City or Training-City.Leading-Cities, Take-up Cities and Training Cities1.

Cities are expected to work simultaneously inthe five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality oflife, equity and environmental sustainability.The City Prosperity Initiative is a practicalframework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainabilitypolicies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that providescollaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.Specifically,it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a moreholistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge todeploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity pathwill be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow andlopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. Therationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization ofprosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies thatthreaten rather than enhance sustainability.Byestimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globallycomparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for trackingprogress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations incities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspondto locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiativewill enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoringof urban prosperity.Three intermediate accomplishments of the CitiesProsperity Initiative will be:Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and     future progress towards the prosperity path.At a more local level, the CitiesProsperity Initiative aims at:Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and     project viability for financing.The benefits of engagement arising from theTechnical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative arecaptured in the table below.

This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrumof areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperitypath in a more sustainable manner. UN-Habitat\'swheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the fivedimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in theCity Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmittedthrough the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hubthe local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring theprevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling thedirection, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development ofthe five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.Thehub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations andinstitutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, specialagencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hubrepresents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematicfocus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat\'sthematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches.

Cities are expected to work simultaneously in the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity and environmental sustainability. The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.Specifically, it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that threaten rather than enhance sustainability.By estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring of urban prosperity.Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities Prosperity Initiative will be:Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path are catalyzed through customised action plans. Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and future progress towards the prosperity path.At a more local level, the Cities Prosperity Initiative aims at:Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized urban planning and design interventions. Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban form. Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and project viability for financing.The benefits of engagement arising from the Technical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative are captured in the table below.Technical Advisory PackageUN-Habitat will provide additional support to cities for: BenefitThis will produce:1. Adopting an established and globally recognized policy framework (Prosperity Index and Wheel of Prosperity) for the development and implementation of policies and actions to increase urban prosperity. Certificate recognizing the participation of the city in the Cities Prosperity Initiative2. In-depth and customized estimation of the City Prosperity Index. New up-dated City Index. 3. Conducting a diagnostic and proposing a General Action Plan with policy recommendations to advance prosperity. Action Plan and Road Map4. Sharing best and emerging practices to advance practical solutions and strategies to city challenges Best practices sharing 5. Utilizing UN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative tools and resources, and the opportunity to engage in specialized work-streams as per the different dimensions of prosperity. Accessing tools and resources6. Accessing UN-Habitat extensive knowledge of and experience with sustainable urban development issues related to the 5 dimensions of prosperity. Accessing a critical mass of knowledge and technical advisory services7. Advancing, sustainable solutions and key proposals in partnership with key stakeholders Sustainable solutions 8. Assisting in packaging for funding and linking cities to finance, identifying possible financial sources.Linking cities to finance9. Establishing a local monitoring mechanism with baseline data and benchmarksCreating a monitoring mechanism10. Linking cities and partners across regions and local networks and promoting South-South cooperation Sustainable solutions 11. Evaluating efforts and processes deployed to advance prosperity Lessons LearnedFollowing from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:1.Cities create conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity2.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map3.Cities are capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity pathThe City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines, training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis, and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity path in a more sustainable manner. UN-Habitat\'s wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship, absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.The hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat\'s thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat\'s thematic Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat\'s Branches will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above) especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms to track progress on a path of prosperity. In addition, UN-Habitat\'s regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin America is already underway.A number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative.

Through this project, the municipality may be able to shift and rapidly address its high rates of informality and deprivation therefore achieving a more sustainable urban development. Land readjustment is a technique whereby a group of neighboring landowners in an urban-fringe area are combined in a partnership for the unified planning, servicing and subdivision of their land with the project costs and benefits being shared between the landowners. The benefits of land readjustment are vast for urban development. The attraction of land readjustment for landowners is that they can develop their property and get value gains from urbanization. For local governments, it ensures efficient urbanization of land at reduced cost because the project site and infrastructure rights of way do not have to be purchased or compulsorily acquired. The cost of the infrastructure and subdivision can be financed with a short\\/medium-term loan which, depending on the land contribution ratio of participating landowners, may be repaid through the sale of some of the new building plots. However, for land readjustment approach UN-Habitat is proposing to bear fruits, there needs to be a conducive legal framework, professional capability to manage the process and a genuine commitment to stakeholder and community engagement, which is often lacking in developing countries. Other limitations may include that the land may take many years to be developed and occupied, whereas the government\'s objective is to achieve early development and a flow of revenues. Another limitation is that the ability of land readjustment projects to engage with and provide access to land for lower-income groups is limited by the need to provide the original land owners with an increased value for the smaller plot areas they receive after land subdivision and servicing.The Participatory and Inclusive Land Readjustment (PILaR) aims at enabling Medellin \\u2013and potentially developing countries\\u2013 to use the land readjustment technique to undertake orderly and proactive city extension and densification in a pro-poor, participatory and gender-responsive manner, empowering the municipalities to facilitate this process. UN-Habitat aims at introducing PILaR as a new service for national governments and local authorities to better tackle urbanization challenges, such as urban sprawl and the slums, through a rights-based approach where participation and inclusivity will be central. The project aims therefore at creating a conducive environment for PILaR in Medellin, Colombia: enhancing legislation, if needed, and building the capacity of the municipality in land readjustment and participatory processes. The project will also look at improving the supply of serviced urban land through orderly and negotiated process of PILaR (prior to investment phase). As a result of this project, an investment phase shall follow up creating a compact, well connected and inclusive neighborhood, if funding is available. If the project is done, a sound participatory process will have been carried out in the selected site and an overall agreement will be reached for its redevelopment which will create a more compact, well connected, inclusive and sustainable neighborhood. If the project is not done, the situation in Medellin may remain as it is now: a territory with challenges to densify its space in a quick and inclusive manner.

Through this project, the municipality may be able to shift and rapidly address its high rates of informality and deprivation therefore achieving a more sustainable urban development. Land readjustment is a technique whereby a group of neighboring landowners in an urban-fringe area are combined in a partnership for the unified planning, servicing and subdivision of their land with the project costs and benefits being shared between the landowners. The benefits of land readjustment are vast for urban development. The attraction of land readjustment for landowners is that they can develop their property and get value gains from urbanization. For local governments, it ensures efficient urbanization of land at reduced cost because the project site and infrastructure rights of way do not have to be purchased or compulsorily acquired. The cost of the infrastructure and subdivision can be financed with a short\\/medium-term loan which, depending on the land contribution ratio of participating landowners, may be repaid through the sale of some of the new building plots. However, for land readjustment approach UN-Habitat is proposing to bear fruits, there needs to be a conducive legal framework, professional capability to manage the process and a genuine commitment to stakeholder and community engagement, which is often lacking in developing countries. Other limitations may include that the land may take many years to be developed and occupied, whereas the government\'s objective is to achieve early development and a flow of revenues. Another limitation is that the ability of land readjustment projects to engage with and provide access to land for lower-income groups is limited by the need to provide the original land owners with an increased value for the smaller plot areas they receive after land subdivision and servicing.The Participatory and Inclusive Land Readjustment (PILaR) aims at enabling Medellin \\u2013and potentially developing countries\\u2013 to use the land readjustment technique to undertake orderly and proactive city extension and densification in a pro-poor, participatory and gender-responsive manner, empowering the municipalities to facilitate this process. UN-Habitat aims at introducing PILaR as a new service for national governments and local authorities to better tackle urbanization challenges, such as urban sprawl and the slums, through a rights-based approach where participation and inclusivity will be central. The project aims therefore at creating a conducive environment for PILaR in Medellin, Colombia: enhancing legislation, if needed, and building the capacity of the municipality in land readjustment and participatory processes. The project will also look at improving the supply of serviced urban land through orderly and negotiated process of PILaR (prior to investment phase). As a result of this project, an investment phase shall follow up creating a compact, well connected and inclusive neighborhood, if funding is available. If the project is done, a sound participatory process will have been carried out in the selected site and an overall agreement will be reached for its redevelopment which will create a more compact, well connected, inclusive and sustainable neighborhood.

AusAID, the main development partner of this project, has related strategic goals directly, to be addressed by this project:\\u00b7 Sustainable Economic Development: reducing the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors through improved awareness of sustainable urbanisation, planning, land use to mitigate climate change and adapt to rising sea levels and changing climatic conditions\\u00b7 Effective Governance: The Ministerial conference will seek to improve urban, and in particular land governance to deliver better services, improve security and enhance justice and human rights through sensitisation of key issues and ministerial commitment in the conference declaration.\\u00b7 Humanitarian and disaster response: more effective preparedness to disasters and crises in SIDS countries through improves strategies and systems for disaster mitigation and prevention as part of improved urban planning and land management approaches. In order to reach SIDS countries in an effective way, strategic related external partners (other than the requesting partner) have been invited, such as the CARICOM and the Pacific Forum Secretariat, who shall work together with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (HAP lead). For the technical support, universities will participate and support knowledge identification and management: University of South Pacific, University of West Indies and Griffith University, Australia. They shall be the lead organizations in monitoring follow-up after the project implementation. Other Universities may join in this role upon later confirmation. It is also expected that other Society sectors such as SIDS networks and NGOs are invited to participate and contribute to the project, such as SIDSnet, PacificSIDS, Blue Space Caribbean.Other UN agencies have an important role as external partners, particularly the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs SIDS Unit, UNDP and UNEP. The United Nations has been assisting and extending cooperation to SIDS in their sustainable development efforts through the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States finalized at the Global Conference held in Barbados in 1994, known also as the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA). This programme was reviewed and revamped at the five-year review held at the Twenty-second special session of the General Assembly in 1999, and the ten-year review held in Mauritius (10-14 January 2005). The latter outcome is known as the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (MSI). The UN-OHRLLS mandate from the General Assembly calls upon the Office to engage in advocacy and mobilization of international support and resources for the implementation of the Programme of Action for SIDS. During the Rio + 20 Conference, concern was raised upon the 5-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation (MSI+5) concluding that \\u201cSIDS have made less progress than most other groupings, or even regressed, in economic terms, especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability. Sea-level rise and other adverse impacts of climate change continue to pose a significant risk to SIDS and their efforts to achieve sustainable development and for many represent the gravest of threats to their survival and viability, including for some through the loss of territory[1]\\u201d. As a result, the need for enhanced and continued support from the UN System was stressed and the assembling of the Third International Conference on SIDS in 2014 was recommended. Both recommendations were endorsed by the General Assembly and the SIDS Conference is expected to take place in Samoa in September 2014. Even though the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean will take the lead, the whole project has been continuously discussed and coordinated with the Urban Planning and Design Branch, as well as with the Urban Legislation, Land and Governance Branch, providing the necessary source for high-level policy advice but also for knowledge management and advocacy.

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida\\/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district\\/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project.

D\'autre part, les structures de proximit\\u00e9 peuvent assurer un suivi permanent des conflits r\\u00e9solus pour \\u00e9viter leur rebondissement.  En 2012 environ 99 cas de conflits fonciers sont trait\\u00e9s par les structures locales avec succ\\u00e8s dans le territoire de Masisi (CLPC, NRCF), ce qui montre un d\\u00e9but d\'appropriation de la m\\u00e9diation par les communaut\\u00e9s locales. L\'\\u00e9valuation externe du programme de UN Habitat effectu\\u00e9 en  F\\u00e9vrier 2012, a montr\\u00e9 que les communaut\\u00e9s locales ont plus confiance aux structures de r\\u00e9solutions pacifiques des conflits fonciers qu\'aux instances judiciaires, ce qui montre un certain degr\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9silience de leur part.Dans le processus de mise en \\u0153uvre, un lien sera \\u00e9tabli avec le Cluster Protection au niveau provincial et National \\u00e0 travers le Groupe de Travail Habitat, Terre et Propri\\u00e9t\\u00e9.

Approximate 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C in 542 communities, 281 of which are located entirely or mostly (50% or more of their built up area) in Area C. The draft Operational Coordination Plan details these communities further and clarifies how many are covered by Detailed Outline Plans. As the development pressure on Area C is increasing, it is important to accelerate the planning effort and to address the serious planning backlog, as evidenced by the large amount of demolition orders and\\/or stop work orders issued.Furthermore it is essential that affected village councils are fully aware of the need for planning; the risks involved and, are as such, in a position to engage with the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to negotiate the approval of their plans on behalf of their communities. It is important also that they are in position to guide the implementation of the plans. Until now, most planning efforts were led by IPCC, a local NGO. If the intent is to seriously scale up the planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. This means that, apart from IPCC who played a key role in piloting planning in Area C and in supporting Village Councils in their negotiations with the Israeli Civil Administration, other capacity will need to be mobilized. Recently, private sector firms have been contracted to prepare five lots of plans for Area C. Coordinating all ongoing initiatives will require capacity to support Village Councils ensuring proper community participation and ownership, coherence and exchange of lessons learnt, quality control and support in the negotiations with the ICA. Currently, the engagement with the ICA on the approval of plans is not structured. The situation on the ground and the impact of plans is also not properly documented. Better monitoring is needed with improved information sharing as parties are seeking a common ground in terms of numbers and progress made. Apart from reducing the risk of displacement, by creating a planning framework that helps to overcome standing demolition or stop work orders, the main reasons to prepare Detailed Outline Plans is to guide concrete improvements in the living conditions of Palestinian Communities in Area C. So far, there is insufficient link between the efforts in planning and investment initiatives.Therefore the project will build upon existing initiatives and other systems and approaches that have a proven record of success, while also incorporating the challenges and lessons-learned into its actions moving forward. For example, a good source of knowledge includes the International Peace and Cooperation Centre, which has played a leading role in providing planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. After many years working in the area, it has now built up a solid base of experience in engaging and supporting Palestinian communities, ensuring their ownership of the planning process, in their interaction with the ICA. Indeed, IPCC is at the forefront of developing relevant planning approaches and it is well-placed to help build the capacity of the Palestinian private sector in relation to planning. Moreover, the close relationship of UN-Habitat and IPCC demonstrates the basis of lessons-learned in the formation of the logic of this intervention.Further, UN-Habitat\'s played a strategic role in the development of the Strategic Action Plan since September 2009, jointly reviewing with relevant civil society organisations, OCHA, UNSCO and the Quartet, how planning could be made more effective to prevent displacement and facilitate local development of Palestinian Communities in Area C. These actions enhanced the understanding of the Agency in the issues faced in planning in this area of the world.Finally, there was an explicit request from the Palestinian Authority to UN-Habitat to mobilize its planning expertise in Area C, to provide a link with the broader work of the UN on the topic, both at the humanitarian, development and political level and to facilitate the advocacy work by the international community.The project aims at improving the Palestinian management structure and process with involvement of all relevant domestic and international community stakeholders, as well to facilitate technical cooperation with the ICA in the appropriate cases. In this respect the project wants to develop planning standards and guidelines for qualitative community-driven local Outline Planning.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2013-08-02\",\"end-date\":\"2015-05-31\",\"sector\":\"Urban development and management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2013-08-02\",\"period_end\":\"2015-05-31\",\"value_date\":\"2013-08-02\",\"value\":1003518}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":994789,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":614865,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"PS\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2421\":{\"title\":\"Participatory Review Of Egyptian Planning And Related Urban Development Legislation To Support Sustainable Urban Development- Egypt\",\"description\":\"UN-Habitat will work with in-country stakeholders involved in the urban planning process focusing on national and local institutions, governorates, employees and staff of municipalities, academics, legal practitioners, community and civil society groups as well as the private sector to ensure home-grown and locally owned assessment and strategy development. Key stakeholder groups will be targeted directly through developing their understanding and capacity around urban law to allow for culturally sensitive urban redevelopment. The project, through the review of the Egyptian legal framework and the identification of urban redevelopment and densification best practice, will analyse the current legal systems operating at city and national level, with regard to land regularization to encourage planned development on the urban fringe and will improve the capacities of local authorities to design and implement legal reforms. Different methods, including local consultations and the convening of Expert Group Meetings, will be used to gauge demand. An important element of such engagement will be enabling local to national dialogue to assist law makers at national and local level to work in concert.

Internally, the project activities will be complement and support UN-Habitat\'s planning initiatives in the country.The selection of pilot sites and locations for further analysis of urban development trends will be categorized into four main groups. The first category will focus on urban expansion in metropolitan areas (Greater Cairo Region). Here, two locations will be chosen, examining the process of urban expansion on agriculture, privately owned land, as well as exploring urban expansion dynamics on state owned land. In addition to that, a second category will be investigating urban expansion in a small\\/ secondary city (defined in the Egyptian context as city with about 50,000 inhabitants).

Upper Egypt is inhabited by 40% of the national population, and by 66% of Egypt\'s extreme poor, making it the most vulnerable region in the country. With a poverty incidence of 41.2%, Upper Egypt is almost doubling the national average of 21.6%.Minya was selected as the target governorate in consultation with the Government of Egypt because it displays high levels of persistent poverty, as well as the second lowest HDI ranking amongst governorates. It is the most populated in Upper Egypt, with approximately 4.6 million inhabitants, 82% of which live in rural areas. There are over 3,000 villages in the governorate, comprising more than 30% of the poorest villages of Upper Egypt. A number of assessments recently conducted under UN programs show high levels of unemployment and underemployment in Minya, especially in rural areas and among youth and women. The post-revolution economic downturn has triggered a rise in crime rates, food insecurity, child labor and added pressure on existing infrastructure and services as well as on local natural resources. Inter-linkages and dynamics among human security threats observed in Minya are described below.To work towards this purpose, UN-Habitat will work in partnership with other UN agencies ( UN RC, UNIDO, UN Women, ILO, IOM,) involved in the project to create and build the capacity of community and youth groups to play an active role in identifying community needs, formulating action plans, designing implementation strategies and fundraising from local partners. The project will coordinate with governmental authorities ( MoLD and Governorate of Minya) to ensure the mainstreaming of community engagement in planning and resource allocation.Economic security of vulnerable communities will be achieved through creation of a participatory plat form, human security forum, that will be a tool to identify real community needs and prepare community action plans with regards to achieving human economic security. UN-Habitat will adopt an urban upgrading approach to achieve this purpose, through neighborhood upgrading initiatives and other initiatives related to urban upgrading and governance.As a direct intervention, the project will implement upgrading projects which will serve beneficiaries to be more economically active and self- sufficient. To achieve this target, Human Security Forum will be created and activated on both village level and district level, the HS forum will include the active community leaders and members from different sectors like youth, women and community focal points adding to governmental officials and NGOs. The project will build the capacity of Human Security Forum to identify the community needs, form an action plan and to be able to raise resources for the implementation of the projects. An integrated capacity building program will be conducted to enable the HS fora to play its designed role. Training will be conducted by different project partners according to their mandates to provide the HS fora with skills to identify the community needs, creating dialogue with the government to meet the needs, conduct fund raising activities for sustainability and acting as a communication channel between the local community and local authorities.In order to sustain the interventions , the project will work to mainstream the the HS forum through up -scaling the concept to the governorate level, a linkage between the district level HS forum and the governorate of Minya to assure that the needs of the local communities are reflected in the upper level planning process.

A UN humanitarian coordination framework for multi sectoralpurposes will be developed at Damascus level and piloted in the city of Homs.Results and experience will lead to scaling up the approach in Syria in otherkey locations. The primary objective ofdeveloping a coordination framework for UN country team is to decentralizehumanitarian coordination at neighbourhood and city level to be as close aspossible to communities, municipalities and neighborhoods. Technical assistance to local partners ondefining recovery and response in key sectors is part of the pilot. The city ofHoms is proposed as a pilot due to the growing humanitarian needs, presence ofUN operational hub and a large number of actors that need to be coordinated toleverage capacities. Coordination will take place in two neighborhoods as apilot where actors covering basic services, health education, shelter and otherareas will be convened together to promote coordination in an integratedmanner. The city scale is comprised of two levels: The neighborhoods in Syriancities are often an area comprising population between 2.000 and up to 250.000inhabitants. The two neighborhoods and communities will be selected throughlocal community meetings with community based organizations, IDPs and communitymembers. The goal is to choose one neighbourhood each in Government andopposition controlled areas to begin neighbourhood emergency response planning inthese affected neighborhoods. Since the neighborhoods in Syria are normallydense and are currently hosting large numbers of IDPs, local emergency actionplans for each neighbourhood will be further divided into 20 communities asunits.Providing access to public services as education or healthcare as wellas ensuring functioning basic infrastructure services of water, sanitation,waste collection and energy can protect people from further deprivation andviolence by reducing immediate risks. The local emergency plans will identifylocal community initiatives to be supported in 20 communities during theproject duration. Capacities of local NGO, Syrian Arab Red Crescent and community basedorganizations will be strengthened in this process. Neighbourhood based localemergency plans will facilitate decision making, consensus, prioritization ofefforts already taking place or in need of support. Outcome 2 Increased availability of shelter needs assessment data, municipalshelter coordination and strategy among sector partners Syria has 14Governorates and each Governorate includes a range of districts, administrativeunits as towns and cities. Currently IDPs are sheltering in informal shelters, publicand private buildings, rental accommodation, unfinished and sub-standard privateapartments and vacant places and slightly damaged houses. However the largest numbersof Syrian IDPs are being hosted by friends, families, neighbors and relatives.In addition, vacant houses in areas where people have left for other cities arein use by IDPs. Current response to shelter needs is based on Governmentmanaged collective centres where over 800 shelters are targeted covering lessthan 5% of IDP population across Syria. UN-Habitat\'s added comparativeadvantage in the shelter sector working group will be to understand the needsof the remaining 95% percent IDPs and develop shelter support options for shortand medium term response. As no data and assessment for the sector isavailable, SDC funding will be utilized to develop shelter needs and housing damageassessments in 4 pilot cities by launching the assessment and developing astrategy in cooperation with shelter sector leads and partners. Municipal sheltercoordination and strategy for the city will be improved through leading two municipalpilots in select cities of Aleppo and Homs. The pilots will reinforce andestablish shelter coordination and information capacity in the municipaltechnical services departments. Aleppo city is selected due to the scale of displacementand IDPs residing across the city in dormitories, public and private buildings,slightly damaged houses, host families and rental apartments and make shiftshelters. Whereas city of Homs, the third largest city in Syria, is a UN huband lacks shelter coordination and strategy among municipal authorities andshelter partners. The key specific strategicresults will be as follows: a) increased municipal shelter coordination amonglocal authorities, technical services departments, NGOs, charities, privatesector, engineering and architecture related professional bodies and communities;b) development of shelter packages and options in cooperation with sheltersector partners particularly for host families, IDPs in informal shelters andin need of upgrading or new shelter options and repair related support, and; c)development of an overview of cities, displacement and hosting support, andshelter, infrastructure and basic services needs through rapid city profiles.This strategic outcomewill support the development of the next SHARP for 2014 and support foradditional shelter response options beyond collective centres only. Theanalysis and outcome of 4 shelter assessments, housing damage assessment andrapid profiles will lead to development of short to medium term solutions,options and strategy for the sector. During field visits by members of shelterworking group, gaps in shelteroptions and availability of shelter and housing packages to support IDPsresiding in various shelter conditions are supported by the shelter sector.Shelter packages must also address upgrading support and site management thatwill be required for both private finished and buildings and host communities. Outcome 3Increased knowledge and technicalresources available to shelter sector stakeholders on addressing immediate shelterneedsWhile technical capacities in development sector including engineering,architecture and physical planning are strong in Syria, these actors are not substantivelyengaged in coordinated emergency shelter response although more recently theEngineers Syndicates have become engaged. Lack of appropriate and affordableframework for addressing needs of Syria\'s urban population has historically contributedto significant informal construction practices. Around 40% of housing in urbanareas is informal. There has been limited attention to the importance of genderissues in urban planning and development, and limited experience in pro-poorhousing approaches. Understanding of environmental issues is however betterdeveloped and practices on historic conservation are well developedparticularly as a result of GIZ\'s technical assistance.Issues of community participation, gender, environment and pro-poorhousing form the backbone to inclusive reconstruction. Current knowledge gapsand lack of appropriate practices in this area will be a major constraint insecuring a housing rehabilitation and reconstruction process that is conduciveto addressing causal issues of the Syrian crisis, unless capacities can bebuilt amongst key urban civil society stakeholders (professionals, academics,private sector and communities) and local government on such issues. Building on the results of Outcome 2, local expert inputs, betterunderstanding of environmental and gender issues related to housing as well asissues of informality, the project will provide technical resources andstrategies to guide the shelter sector in providing appropriate sheltersolutions.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2013-10-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-06-30\",\"sector\":\"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2013-10-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-06-30\",\"value_date\":\"2013-10-01\",\"value\":831578}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":977956,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":1037765,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"SY\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2441\":{\"title\":\"Cities Prosperity Initiative (2013-2015) -  Municipal Of Cajeme\",\"description\":\"TheUN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative is a strategic policy initiative forcities and partners that are committed to aligning their policies, operationsand strategies with UN-Habitat\'s fresh notion of prosperity. Cities are expected to work simultaneously inthe five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality oflife, equity and environmental sustainability.The City Prosperity Initiative is a practicalframework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainabilitypolicies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that providescollaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.Specifically,it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a moreholistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge todeploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity pathwill be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow andlopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. Therationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization ofprosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies thatthreaten rather than enhance sustainability.Byestimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globallycomparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for trackingprogress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations incities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspondto locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiativewill enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoringof urban prosperity.Three intermediate accomplishments of the CitiesProsperity Initiative will be:Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and     future progress towards the prosperity path.At a more local level, the CitiesProsperity Initiative aims at:Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and     project viability for financing.The benefits of engagement arising from theTechnical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative arecaptured in the table below.

This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrumof areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperitypath in a more sustainable manner. UN-Habitat\'swheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the fivedimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in theCity Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmittedthrough the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hubthe local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring theprevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling thedirection, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development ofthe five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.Thehub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations andinstitutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, specialagencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hubrepresents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematicfocus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat\'sthematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization ofthe Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat giventhe direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of UrbanProsperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity andenvironmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat\'s thematicBranches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat\'s Brancheswill be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities toprepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriateinnovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitateoperationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technicaladvisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanismsto track progress on a path of prosperity. Inaddition, UN-Habitat\'s regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers willplay a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities ProsperityInitiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtainedfrom the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of threeconsultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and LatinAmerica is already underway.Anumber of external partners will also play a critical role in the realizationof the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local andmetropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regionalacademic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks andHabitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitatwill rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing datafor the estimation of CPIs.

The project will support the Land Commission in fulfilling its role as the leading agency on reforms in the land sector and in pursuing more effective land governance in Liberia. It will also support much-needed and important outreach and education on the Land Commission\'s landmark new Land Rights Policy, finalized in May 2013, which provides clear and important guarantees for, inter alia, rights for communities to customary land, and women\'s rights to land. New priorities under the proposed project will add an additional and needed new focus on urban land disputes and on concession-related disputes. A combination of activities and research will be undertaken, which will feed into an ultimate policy on alternative dispute resolution, based on Liberian experiences and traditions, human rights principles, and national and international best practices. The policy formulation process will also include attention to differing effects on men and women, rural and urban dwellers, and winners and losers in land disputes.The main focus of the project is on pilot Land Coordination Centres (LCCs), set up under the last tranche of PBF funding. Research on existing land dispute resolution mechanisms funded by UN-Habitat in 2011 found that multiple community-level mechanisms already existed[1]. Thus, rather than adding a new actor to the mix, the LC decided to set up centres that would provide a umbrella to coordinate all those ad hoc community actors into a system. The LCCs do outreach and education, establish a common documentation system for dispute resolvers, track the work done by all dispute resolvers to avoid forum shopping, keep a repository of documents and data, follow up on resolved disputes to help ensure sustainability, and provide training and technical assistance to community members in their dispute resolution work. The LCCs also collect and document best practices and lessons learned. UN-Habitat and USAID\'s Land Conflict Resolution Project (LCRP) are jointly supporting the LCCs. LCCs were piloted in 5 counties covering 10 districts determined by LC research to be land dispute \\u201chotspots\\u201d.The project has three major expected accomplishmentsEA1. Development of a system of land dispute resolution, through support to Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community land dispute resolution services, including coordination with work on concessionsEA2.  Improved understanding of urban disputes, and their effects on women, as well as the displaced, for Land Commission\\/New AgencyEA3.  Policies and transition strategy established for alternative dispute resolution services in new Land AgencyActivities Activities continued from the previous PBF project are:(a) Core support and technical assistance to the pilot Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community dispute resolution services (provided by, inter alia: traditional elders, statutory officials, women\'s groups such as those supported by UN-Women\'s conflict project, UNMIL-supported Peace Committees, youth, and others); (b) Promoting awareness of land rights, land laws, and options for peaceful resolution of land disputes, through the activities of the LCCs and at LC central level (in partnership with USAID\\/LCRP); (c) Developing a national land dispute resolution policy, using results from LCC activities and working with interagency Land Dispute Resolution Taskforces at national and local level (bringing together Government agencies, civil society and other stakeholders) (d) Developing a national alternative dispute resolution system for all disputes, with the Ministry of JusticeNew activities will include:(a) Establishment of a new Land Coordination Centre focusing on urban land disputes; (b) Institutionalisation of conflict-sensitive concession agreements with built-in mechanisms for recognition of community land rights and conflict resolution with communities, via the work of a new conflict and concession Program Officer at the Land Commission; (c) Technical assistance to the LC as it begins a transition to a new land agency, to ensure that new land administration and land use and management responsibilities are linked clearly to the nascent land dispute resolution system; (d) Ensuring joint activities are undertaken by LCCs and the PBF-funded Justice and Security Hubs (through, inter alia, LC training and education of Hub staff on land cases; joint outreach and education initiatives; mutual referral systems); (e) Absorbing already-established trusted and professional surveying capacity into the LCCs to improve land dispute resolution capacity (surveyors will be drawn from the Norwegian Refugee Council\'s land disputes project, which is shutting down)New studies (focusing on urban land disputes):(a) Case studies of 1-3 real-time urban land disputes with significant conflict potential, focusing on analysis of ripeness and possible solutions (if cases are ongoing) or sustainability of solutions (if cases have been resolved). Possible solutions will be examined with a special effort to identify mechanisms to help secure agreements through public investments in infrastructure and services. The studies will also include an analysis of institutional framework and gaps. The studies willproduce recommendations on policy solutions (including regarding forced evictions\\/resettlement), methodologies specifically tailored for urban land dispute resolution, and any institutional changes needed(b) Identifying the land and property challenges faced by urban women in Liberia, proposing options for addressing them. This study will particularly draw upon the work of the Land and Gender Desk supported by UNWomen in the Ministry of Gender and Development- Key target groups\\/beneficiaries:An alternative land dispute resolution system will primarily benefit the poor and the most vulnerable, including women, who may be financially unable to afford court fees or who may believe court decisions are for sale to the highest bidder. Indigenous people, who have traditional tribal ownership certificates which fall short of full statutory title, will also benefit from an alternative system. An increase in the capacity of communities to settle disputes peacefully will have overall benefits for everyone, increasing social cohesion and reconciliation and reducing flashpoints for conflict. And in addition, any bona fide statutory landowner facing counterclaims or disputes who can regularize their tenure will also benefit, and will be able to use their land with more certainty. This should lead to major economic benefits and stability for the country. The possibility of decreasing the burden on the court system will also have quantifiable benefits. One study in 2008 showed that approximately 1500 land cases were pending in two counties alone, and that land cases in courts can take 8-12 years to resolve. An alternate resolution system will be cheaper, easier to access, and should take much less time.Studies on urban land disputes and recommendations on solutions for those who may be the \\u201closers\\u201d in land regularisation (e.g. squatter communities or communities in concession areas) will also benefit those who may lack strict legal rights but for whom social policy solutions are needed (to avoid the risks associated with creating large groups of angry, dispossessed people with nothing left to lose).

Emerging fromthe 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address thisissue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically andconceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional landadministration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leavingup to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and\\/or customary approachesfor their tenure security. Prior to GLTN launch in 2006, an analysis was conducted which drewseveral important conclusions. First,while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policiesthat have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive andlarge-scale land tools. Second, aconclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed todeliver their expected results: existing technical solutions are too expensive,inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries,unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead arange of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in country cannot bedone at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of variousunderlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination,strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiativesand continuous dialogues andcommunications between and amongst key stakeholders including government (atvarious levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia\\/researchinstitutions, grassroots and target communities themselves. To address thesechallenges, UN-Habitat has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment ofthe Global Land Tool Network that aims at contributing to poverty reduction andto the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gendersensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poorsince its launch in 2006. GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant resultsin its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-termevaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, thereis now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gendersensitive and large scale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as therecognition of the need for a \\u2018continuum of land rights\' to replace the moreconventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Globaldiscourse on key GLTN\'s tools and approaches are well captured by variousglobal and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bankis taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and AdministrationFramework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and implementationby member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance on Tenure of Land, Forests andFisheries, wherein UN-Habitat has played a critical role, the adoption of theAfrican Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted bythe Third African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development (AMCHUD)and the Bamako Action Plan. Moreover, Phase 1 hasalready developed significant land tools and training packages ready forrolling out with partners at national and local government levels.Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for theircapacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteriatool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and trainingfor trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, theInternational Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt andimplement the same on their country-level projects in various countries.

As part of GLTN Phase 2,the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-Habitatoperations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementationin targeted countries and\\/or cities\\/municipalities and the needed capacity development initiativeswill be undertaken.

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities.

To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district\\/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2013-09-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-03-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2013-09-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-03-31\",\"value_date\":\"2013-09-01\",\"value\":1461326}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":1454302,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":1461326,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"LB\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2504\":{\"title\":\"Rehabilitation Of Dar Al Consul Into Residential And Civic Complex\",\"description\":\"The project aims at strengthening theresilience ofPalestinians and protecting thePalestiniancultural and local identity in East Jerusalem.Specifically, the project isaddressing the problems of housing, thedisruption of the social structure, and the deteriorated living environment inside the Old City by improving the living conditions of a group of Palestinianfamilies, most of which are senior residents of limited to middle income. They have been living for long years inside the Old City and hold the memory of the place.The project will provide to the residents of the targeted historical complexa better living environment through rehabilitation works and eliminating the risk factors resulting fromliving in deteriorated buildings.The rehabilitation works will address variousaspects and stages of decay, such as structural instability, unsafe electrical anddysfunctional mechanical installations, humidity, inadequate lighting andaccess difficulties, especially for the elderly.In addition, the resident families will enjoy agood provision of open space that accommodates private courtyards, domesticgardens of indigenous Palestinian local character, social and seasonal events.Meanwhile, the historical character of thecomplex and the houses will be preserved.The project also addresses the problems of lack of social and community services for youth ,lack of variety in the commercial and Palestinian touristic attractions and services inside the Old City. In response to this, the project entails the rehabilitation of a vacantdecayed and deserted space on the ground floor of the targeted historical complex.The space will beconverted into a new civic center that will act as a hub for a diverse range ofvisitors and youth of both genders.The action will comprise a package of activitiesand commercial uses that will be unique and will fill a gap in the servicesoffered inside the Old City, hence create an attractive hub for its residentsand visitors alike. Hereby, the project will capitalize on the strategiclocation of the premises -being adjacent to one of the centrally located marketareas inside the Old City (Khan Alzait) in the Islamic Quarter- and thehistoric character of the complex to promote Palestinian identity. Hence, itwill counter act Israeli policies that aim at weakening the Palestinianidentity inside the Old City.In addition, the project addresses the problems of youth social problem, and the high rates of school dropouts.The civic center will include youth knowledge andcareer guidance facilities. It will provide them with a space that is equippedwith modern tools of communication, knowledge gaining and self-expression. Itwill also provide youth development programs that are focused on careerdevelopment and education guidance.The design of the civic centre and its functional programwill cater for creating a spatial setting that allows the Palestinian youth ofboth genders, who suffer from isolation and limited development choices to enjoy an attractive atmosphere of social andcultural diverse interactions throughthe center activities . The interaction will be directed to focus on learningfrom Palestinian entrepreneurs, accomplished young professionals, and thecentre operation staff and global visitors. In addition, the operation plan ofthe centre will accommodate regular events that focus on youthdevelopment. The project will build on the experience, existing programsand networks of Al Quds University to establish and operate the above mentioneddevelopment programs. The program will include education and career guidancespecialized training, in addition to exposure and links to regional andinternational capacity building initiatives and job opportunities. This willhelp youth graduating from Palestinian universities to overcome some of thebarriers that narrow their perspective towards education and reduces theiraccess to rewarding jobs. Students who live in the Old City will be given preferential consideration for benefiting from the abovementioned opportunities andactivities.Aclosely related matter to the above mentioned problems, is youth weak access to employment and jobopportunities. In this regards, the projectis anchored around engaging Palestinianyouth, in particular Palestinian students and newly graduating students fromAl-Quds University, in various stages of the development process. This willallow for a capacity building model that enables the selected youth to gainhands on experience. This will help bridging the existing gab resulting fromthe weak economic activity and limited private investment, which minimizeemployment opportunities and weaken Palestinian access to job opportunities. UN-Habitatand Al Quds University will coordinate the selection of suitable courses andstudents to participate in the project. The selected students will be providedwith the necessary training to perform the required tasks. They will also beprovided with sufficient explanation and exposure to the development cycle. Youthengagement is perceived to be achieved by two tracks. On the one hand studentswill be engaged through course work, under guidance from their teachers and UN-Habitatspecialized expertise in the preparation of the operation plan and its requiredmarket surveys and needs assessment. On the other hand, new graduating studentswill actively engage in practical training on the operation activities of thecenter, in a manner that qualifies them to be hired directly by the project aspart of its operation staff as fixed staff or interns. This will expose theselected students to the operation cycle, help them understand the businessaspect of it, and gain experience by actual practiceFurthermore , the center will act asan incubator for career development where a job placement program will becreated to keep feeding additional students or interns to work in the center,replacing other interns or trainees who were hired in a previous cycle of thejob placement program. Hence, thecapacity building cycle can keep repeating itself. The existing interns will be supported byaiming at linking them with relevant job opportunities in other places.The project will utilize the significant historic value of the complex through adopting a rehabilitation approach that does not compete with the historic value, rather it enhances it with a sensitive layer of rehabilitation that suites contemporary requirements and responds to the specific needs of the residents, users and visitors. This will result in the creation of a convenient living environment, while maintaining the resident\'s sense of identity and pride. These factors will strengthen the residents\' resilience to the distressed living conditions and the social and political factors that are pushing many residents to leave the Old City.The project will provide thematic services thatcombine the local and historic identity with modern functions andinterpretations. The focus will be on providing services of commercial returnsand civic services to the youth of East Jerusalem, the Old City in particular.The provided services will be integrated in terms of their character.The provided services will be integrated in terms of theircharacter.The proposed solutions adopts a new development model that introduces principles ofeco-friendly and energy efficient models of rehabilitation in a challenginghistorical setting. Aspects of natural ventilation and lighting, solar energyintroduction, natural and traditional landscape design and foliage will beamong the adopted concepts. It will alsoaim at integrating historic preservation and cultural identity protection withmodern life needs. Interventions will not compete with the existing fabric;they will rather be simple introductions that reflect functional needs andspace organization. Needs of the elderly will be among the functionalinterventions to be considered. In addition, the open space design will caterto women and children needs. On theoperational side, the same principles of eco friendly and eco-urbanity themeswill be adopted and enhanced among the Palestinian youth and youngprofessionals targeted by the project.

Due to the limitations of the Liberian Government budget, there is no Government support for the technical staff of the Commission to undertake all of this important work. The Commissioners cannot implement the ambitious work programme alone. It is only through the continuation of the core funding and technical assistance for the programme staff, currently supported by SIDA through UN-Habitat, that the Commission can employ and retain high-performing staff. The strong capacity of the Commission has been recognized by other donors, who also recognize that if SIDA had not made the core support and technical assistance for the staff possible, they would not have had a capable partner who could efficaciously absorb their funds and undertake productive donor-funded activities. SIDA\'s core support and UN-Habitat\'s technical assistance for the Commission\'s technical staff has also therefore been both critical and catalytic.

A key philosophy of the programme is that it will look at the city as a whole rather than from the more common sectorial approach. It will also look at cities in their regional contexts.As illustrated in Figure 1 below, two streams of activities in the first and second years will lead to informed policy analysis and a set of 17 action plans (one per participating city), namely (i) identification of indicators and city-level data collection on multiple dimensions of prosperity, using UN-Habitat\'s City Prosperity Index and (ii) reviews of existing Saudi planning practices and consideration of principles and approaches to a new urban agenda. The participatory processes built into the programme will result in inclusive, evidence-based policy analysis and customised action plans, in direct support of Saudi Arabia\'s Country Programme Outcome 1.2.  The data generated will feed into 17 national reports an all-encompassing State of Saudi Cities Report and a State of Saudi Youth Report. These sets of information will also support the Saudi national reporting to Habitat III.Through using UN-Habitat\'s City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous.  It includes various indices and indicators that are relevant to cities and important for prosperity-oriented public policy-making. The Index focuses on individual cities and measures prosperity across seven dimensions \\u2013productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity, environmental sustainability, urban form and structure; and institutions, laws and governance (see Table 1).The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories above. UN-Habitat\'s Wheel of Urban Prosperity, which will be used as a tool in the programme, illustrates the balanced development of the five dimensions \\u201cspokes\\u201d of prosperity (productivity, infrastructure development, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, and environmental sustainability) and the two elements of urban form and structure and institutions, laws and governance (in the centre of the wheel). Table 1:Seven dimensions of prosperityProductivity\\tContributes to economic growth and development, generates income, provides decent jobs and equal opportunities for all through effective economic policies and reforms.Infrastructure development\\tProvides adequate infrastructure- water, sanitation, roads, information and communication technology- in order to improve living standards and enhance productivity, mobility and connectivity.Quality of life\\tEnhances the use of public space for the sake of community cohesion and civic identity, and guarantees individual and material safety and security.Equity and social inclusion\\tEnsures equitable (re)distribution of the benefits of prosperity, reduces poverty and the incidence of slums, protects the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, enhances gender and youth equality, and ensures civic participation in the social, political and cultural spheres.Environmental sustainability\\tValues the protection of the urban environment and natural assets while ensuring growth, pursues energy efficiency, reduces pressure on surrounding land and natural resources, reduces environmental losses through creative, environment-enhancing solutions.Urban form and structure \\tRecognized the element of urban planning that determines the urban form, including  street planning and how it influences the other dimensions of prosperity, including street networks and mobility patterns.Institutions, laws and governance\\tGovernment institutions, laws and governance will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to takeThrough using the City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous. The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories. Since shared and balanced development is a crucial feature of prosperity, none of the dimensions must prevail over the others and all must be kept roughly \\u2018equal\' on the path of prosperity. UN-Habitat will be including youth and gender-specific indicators within the Index across the 17 cities, with the goal of determining a baseline on the needs of these population groups. Government institutions, laws and urban planning, innovation and creativity will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to take.As part of the evidence for the policy process, a baseline of the legislative and institutional context will be undertaken. This will be used as a framework for analytical study into the principal policy objectives to be addressed, including the collective functioning of the various levels of Saudi government and administration in delivering outcomes at the local level. Initial discussions suggest that priorities may include: a review of the Urban Planning Act; analysis of implementation bottlenecks of existing spatial strategy and plans; responses to informal settlements; and, options for preventing urban sprawl and urban expansion. Once the action plans have been agreed upon, recommendations for any key areas of legislative\\/institutional change will be provided proposed and validated through both desk based and participatory means.  An implementation plan for undertaking any legislative and institutional changes will also be prepared as part of the programme.The programme will then in its third and fourth year support the implementation of three innovative, but representative, demonstration projects prioritized through the action planning process. These will be implemented with co-financing from the municipalities of the three cities selected and be carefully documented for wider learning.The programme will capitalize on relevant projects, studies and surveys that have been conducted through the existing and revised National Spatial Strategy and in support of the National and Local Urban Observatories in Saudi Arabia. It will significantly build on them and undertake to develop capacity for implementation of plans. By doing this, the process will ensure that urban planning, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks become an instrument of city prosperity and well-being. A new urban and regional planning vision will require a number of changes in the structure and growth of Saudi cities, moving away from urban sprawl and low densities to more compact cities,  replace segregation, including that of informal settlements with more integrated cities, and replace congested cities with those that are better connected. The programme will promote a number of options for urban patterns of green growth through city-region planning and creating sustainable urban space through planned city-extensions. It will also promote and build capacity around the importance of public space (with proper layouts) and options for street development. An important component of the localization of the City Prosperity Index in Saudi Arabia will be to integrate streets into the analysis, and to recognize that urban form, planning and structure play an important part in a city\'s prosperity.  Capacity development is critical to the programme\'s overall purpose and success, and will be addressed from the start (through a capacity needs\\/gap assessment and orientation workshops), and throughout the four years (with customized training, international experts and exchange visits), to enhance the set of skills required for the new urban vision, and to ensure sustainability. The programme will develop and strengthen national and local institutional and human resources capacities to understand, anticipate, plan, and manage urban growth.  The Saudi Training Centre on Sustainable Urbanization, expected to be established during the programme phase through a separate source of funding, will provide an important mechanism to sustain and continually enhance this knowledge and skills.To create a sound participatory process, an important component will be to enable and build capacities for fuller engagement by young women and men, and the overall female population, in Saudi urbanization processes and outcomes. The programme will establish mechanisms for such participatory process through mapping and analysis of youth concerns in cities, the integration of youth and gender indicators into the City Prosperity Index, and workshops for young people and women to constructively engage on urban issues and enhance their capacity in urban development issues that can feed into sustainable structures for further engagement. These activities will help identify champions and organizations to launch a Saudi Youth Sustainable Urbanization Network and Saudi Women Sustainable Urbanization Network, and to support them to engage throughout the implementation of the programme.The population of the 17 participating cities is the ultimate beneficiaries of this programme. The programme will redefine the role of residents in the process of city development to be more active in defining the city they want. The capacity development component that will improve city planning and management will result in improved services to the local populaton. It is expected that laws and regulations reforms will help also to simplify procedures for local population access to city services. Local authorities and involved Ministries will themselves directly benefit through enhancing knowledge and experience on new approaches to manage their cities in a more sustainable way. Decision-makers through updated policies and strategies and city reports will be able to make more informed decisionsThe programme will be undertaken over a four year period and consists of two main phases, though some of the activities will be implemented and outputs produced through the two phases:Phase I:  Diagnosis, analysis and consultation (24 months): ?\\tInitial baselines and reviews of the institutional and legislative context of Saudi Arabia, urban planning practices, sectoral linkages, women and youth analysis and capacity development needs; ?\\tIntegration of the City Prosperity Index and diagnosis and identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges in Saudi cities, along with future visualization of Saudi cities;?\\tConsultative processes focused on the identification and validation of important policy objectives, the development of hypotheses and recommendations for action, inclusion of youth and women\'s participation including through establishment of two Networks, and a Saudi National Urban Forum;?\\tTraining needs and gap assessment and development of a capacity development strategy;?\\tPreparation of the Saudi Urban Future report and a Youth and Saudi Cities Report for the analysis of different challenges facing prosperity and sustainability of Saudi cities; and?\\tAn advocacy and awareness programme aiming at engaging Saudi stakeholders at all levels and sharing the spirit of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs in reaching out to the public and including their priorities in all levels of plans thinking and execution (continued in Phase II).Phase II: Capacity development and demonstration projects (24 months):  ?\\tDevelopment of a strategic implementation plan and conduct of pilot projects for three cities (large, medium and small (categorized under strategic and economic cities) for the implementation of the recommendations and proposals emanating from the first phase;?\\tTailor-made capacity development workshops and best-in-class comparisons and study visits;?\\tMonitoring through the urban observatories and CPI methodology; andPreparation for the United Nations Housing and Urban Development Summit in 2016 and based on phase one analysis, review of the business environment for planning at various levels for effective projects implementation. As part of the United Nations\' efforts in Saudi Arabia, the programme will contribute to building the pillars of sustainable urbanization, including the enhanced quality of life enjoyed equitably by all city inhabitants. UN-Habitat will capitalize on its important niche to promote and integrate the necessary for broader, inclusive and sustainable urban prosperity, integrating UN values of human rights, including non-discrimination, equity, engagement of youth and women, cultural integrity and ecological balance into how cities are managed and enhance participatory planning methods engaging public agencies, private enterprises, universities, welfare and civil society organizations, including youth initiatives and women\'s organizations.The programme will partners with UNDP, UNDESA, UN Women, The World Bank and Arab Urban Development Institute in the implementation, policy discussion and capacity building activities as well as providing technical advice and support.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2018-02-28\",\"sector\":\"Research\\/scientific institutions\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2018-02-28\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":25000000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":3526045,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":12550000,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"SA\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2545\":{\"title\":\"Recovery Planning Support For Local Government Units (Lgus) In The Philippines In The Wake Of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) - Phase 1\",\"description\":\"Thepresent project is expected to provide the LGUs of Tacloban, Ormoc and Guiuan acritical head-start to formulating appropriate Recovery and RehabilitationPlans, formulated through collaboration and consultation and based onappropriate technical advice.

It is conceived within the framework of the Joint UN programming approach UN-Habitat, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO as the main UN Agency partners to collaborate with GoG partners on providing improved and resilient WASH facilities and services in disaster prone communities in the 3 Northern Regions. In line with the outcomes 4 and 5 of the UNDAF, this project also provides a framework for DFATD to partner with the UN team in this effort and to contribute to GoG\'s efforts towards the implementation of the Ghana Plan of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation.Consistent with Ghana\'s aspirations, the vision and collective programme of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the period 2012-2016 seeks to advance a coherent vision for the UN system in support of key priorities of the Government\'s Development Agenda. The UNDAF aligns with the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) through four thematic areas[1] including infrastructure and human settlements development. WASH is an UNDAF outcome area under the infrastructure and human settlements development thematic area. The 2012-2016 UNDAF includes a key programme component on water, sanitation and hygiene to be implemented in the 5 most deprived regions (Central, Northern, Upper East, Upper West and Volta) of Ghana. The UNDAF Action Plan (UAP) puts some focus on the poorest regions of the country, in particular the activities of the Joint UN Office in Tamale, which focuses on the three northern regions, and includes support to disaster prone communities in these three regions.Natural disaster occurrence in Ghana consists of droughts, epidemic outbreaks, floods, and wildfires. In the 3 Northern regions, disasters significantly impact vulnerable populations in disaster prone areas, and may lead to unnecessary losses of social and economic capital. In particular, recurrent flooding events, which are the most pervasive in terms of financial damages and numbers of people affected, usually result in the disruption of services from WASH facilities, which could lead to significant damages to property and trigger other emergency situations such as outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera, and other water related\\/borne diseases. The combination of these effects reduces the productivity of the population and the losses they suffer are immense and seriously affect their economic and social circumstances. These events tend to have devastating effects on the development of affected communities. Having to ensure that when such floods occur the quality of water supply is not contaminated (during collection, handling, storage, and use) also presents immense challenges to the health of these communities. Rehabilitation costs are usually unaffordable and communities have suffered a drastic fall in their living conditions and opportunities for future development, pushing them further into poverty and deprivation. The situation is further aggravated in those communities where there is a lack of WASH facilities and services. In such circumstances, the challenges include the prevalence of water borne, vector borne and sanitation related diseases as a result of poor drinking water quality and inadequate sanitation. Women, children and the youth suffer the most from the effects of this lack of access to WASH facilities and related services. Initiatives that address and improve the WASH situation for people in disaster prone communities contribute significantly to address most MDGs.In a recent report, the National Disaster Monitoring Organization (NADMO) indicated that it had taken a census of people living in flood prone areas of the country, including the northern regions, and had allocated safe havens in these communities to prepare for the onset of the major rains. The project will work in close collaboration with NADMO in this context, and contribute to WASH components with respect to prior preparations towards mitigating disaster events, make recommendations for interventions during such events, and implement WASH solutions that could be resilient to the effects in the disaster prone communities.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-06-01\",\"end-date\":\"2017-05-30\",\"sector\":\"Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-06-01\",\"period_end\":\"2017-05-30\",\"value_date\":\"2014-06-01\",\"value\":8760102}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":734094,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":3268393,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"GH\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2558\":{\"title\":\"The Project Ofr Rehabilitation Of Community Infrastructure, Imrpovement Of Livelihoods And Empwerment Of Women In The Northern And Eastern Provinces\",\"description\":\"1.

According to the Department of Wildlife, Sri Lanka has the highest density of Wild Elephants in Asian Continent.  In this scenario, Human Elephant Conflicts (HEC) are bound to arise and continue.  According to Department of Wildlife Conservation records, during the period of 2005-2009 an annual average of 70 humans and 185 elephant deaths were reported. In 2012, 73 people and 257 elephants have been killed.  A simultaneous increase is also recorded in the number of injured farmers and serious damage to agricultural crops, houses and other properties. The villages which are isolated and neighboring to forest with elephant habitat face serious challenges Protecting their crops, properties and mobility of people. 2. Project Objectives, Activities and Outputs 2.1 Objective 1: Improving living conditions of returnees and other conflict affected people through restoration of community infrastructure and building disaster resilient communitiesActivity 1.1: Community MobilizationFirstly, in mobilizing communities, building awareness of why it is important to work together and how to organize and what the project is about is carried contacting community representatives and holding small group meetings to discuss 1) community assets, resources and issues 2) problems and their causes, 3) assess the capacity of existing CBO\'s and the feasibility of establishing a new one, 4) generate demand for a large community meeting.Assisted by UN-Habitat, a community holds a large community meeting to discuss the status of existing CBO\'s and to identify capacity gaps or to establish a new CBO. Emphasis is given for representation of women and vulnerable members in the CBO.  In the case where an existing CBO is recognized and well represented by the community, project activities will be carried out with that CBO. In places where there is no representative CBO, UN-Habitat will facilitate the election of a CBO and having it registered with the local authority.Activity 1.2: Preparation of Community Action Plans Facilitated by UN-Habitat, the CBO prepares the Community Action Plan (CAP) for infrastructure. Community Action Planning is a structured process where the community identifies their vulnerabilities and needs in terms of social, economic and physical infrastructure needs. Then they prioritize the needs and plan how to address them taking to consideration options and trade-offs. Finally the plan is presented to all the community members to discus and   to be endorsed. UN-Habitat has developed guidelines to conduct Community Action Planning.Activity 1.3: Community ContractingUN-Habitat together with CBO prepares the detail designs of infrastructure projects with cost estimates based on the CAP. Then project proposals are prepared and obtains endorsement of the community members. Then UN-Habitat awards a community contract to the CBO for project implementation.Activity 1.4: Implementation and Monitoring Following the formalization of the community contracts, the construction \\/implementation of the projects identified will commence. The community, through the CBO, will monitor the progress.  UN-Habitat project technical personnel will provide technical advice on construction to maintain quality and standards. The project will introduce DRR features and standards in all construction work and provide advocacy and knowledge on DRR at the local level by incorporation in all training programmes. The Project will also introduce DRR guidelines and manuals for community construction based on ongoing UN-Habitat DRR initiatives. Training on eco-friendly construction techniques will be conducted to staff, community leaders and stakeholders.Output 1.1.1: 90 Community Based Organizations mobilizedOutput 1.2.1: 90 Community Action Plans for infrastructure preparedOutput 1.2.2: 900 Community members trained in community action planningOutput 1.3.1: 50 Community Contracts AwardedOutput 1.4.1: Reconstruction of 18 Multipurpose Community CentersThe multi-purpose community centers will consist of a community meeting hall, space for conducting mobile health clinics and community consultation areas for grassroots level government officials, agricultural extension officers and family health workers to cater to community needs. These facilities will allow the community to receive support on health and hygiene needs, social services assistance and direct support for their general agricultural needs from the Government. These centers will have toilets and rainwater harvesting facilities. They will be constructed through a community contracting process with resources provided by the Project. The community will take ownership of these assets and will receive training on operations and maintenance. Output 1.4.2: Construction of 10 rainwater harvesting facilities in public buildingsThe project will construct rainwater harvesting facilities in selected public buildings in the target villages. Implementation will conform to the guidelines and standards of the National Rainwater Harvesting Policy, and targeted at enhancing the availability of water supply in order to improve the general living conditions of the community. In addition, rainwater harvesting facilities will also be installed in all new public buildings constructed under this project, making a total of 46 rainwater harvesting systems installed.Output 1.4.3: Construction of 18 PreschoolsDistrict rehabilitation plans developed by the government district administration have prioritized the construction of pre-schools in the Northern Province, particularly in the districts of Killinochchi and Mullaitivu. It is also observed that a large number of villages which are geographically isolated preclude the attendance of children to preschools. This project will identify the 18 most vulnerable villages with a significant child population and build pre-school facilities and train preschool teachers from within the same community. While pre-schools will support the development of children, they will also result in women (housewives \\/ mothers) having more free time to engage in livelihood opportunities.Output 1.4.4: Diploma course for 36 pre-school teachers and the potential teachers in the community for 18 preschools The project will also provide the pre-school training for teachers of the 18 proposed pre-schools. The training will include material in all three languages in keeping with the tri-lingual policy of the Government Output 1.4.5: 90 Communities Resilient to Disaster with Improved Environment established-\\tReconstruction of 10 km of storm water drainageThe Northern and Eastern Provinces experiences serious flooding during the monsoon season, leading to inundation of roads and low lying areas. The project will initiate the construction of approximately 10 km of storm water drains. The community will be trained on maintaining the drains.-\\tDisaster risk reduction (DRR) features to be incorporated into the construction of all community infrastructure -\\t63,500 trees planted by the communitiesThe communities will be engaged in environmental improvements through campaigns for tree planting for home gardening, on road sides and public places to increase the green cover in the villages, thereby mitigating the reduction of trees due to ongoing construction work and increased timber usage at the local level. The project aims to plant 63,500 trees through community actions and to promote edible, fruit bearing plants in order to promote food security and livelihood activities.Output 1.4.6: Community and stakeholder capacities built to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities The project will conduct training in basic construction skills for youth. The training will assist the communities, in the short term, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour for infrastructure construction. There will be two methods of training for the youth in the target group. Firstly, those with sufficient educational qualifications as required by the formal training systems will be enrolled for construction based vocational training. Secondly, training will be conducted to include those who do not have basic educational qualifications in an apprenticeship programme under a master craftsman. Trainees will be able, in both the long and short-term, to use the training acquired through the project to improve their livelihood opportunities and family incomes.2.2 Objective 2: Creating better economic opportunities to communities through the improvement of accessibility to marketsActivity 2.1: Design of Economic Infrastructure (Roads, Irrigation Channels and Storage Facilities) and Awarding of Community ContractsUn-Habitat technical staff together with the CBOs will prepare detail designs with cost estimates for economic infrastructure projects identified in the Community Action Plans. For each project UN-Habitat will award a community contract to the CBO. Training in managing a project will be provided to the CBO for example in procuring material, hiring skilled labour, time keeping etc.Activity 2.2: Implementation and MonitoringFollowing the formalization of the community contracts, the construction \\/implementation of the projects identified will commence. The community, through the CBO, will monitor the progress.  UN-Habitat project technical personnel will provide technical advice on construction to maintain quality and standards.Output 2.1.1:  35 Community Contracts AwardedOutput 2.2.1: 10 Community Storage Facilities builtTo increase the efficiency of the livelihood activities, in particular farming, the project will construct 10 storage facilities for crops, fertilizer and agricultural equipment. This will assist with reducing loss through protection from animal and weather damage.Output 2.2.2 30 km of internal access roads including culverts rehabilitatedThe project will target rehabilitation of internal access roads with required culverts. They will be constructed according to the established standards and specifications for rural roads of the Provincial Road Development Authorities. Training and schedules for regular repair and maintenance will also be provided to the Community Based Organisations. These assets will enable improved access for communities to nearby town centres, transportation of produce to the village markets and create access for children to travel safely to school.Output 2.2.3: 10 Irrigation channels\\/ systems constructedNote: Although Community Infrastructure and Economic Infrastructure have been quantified above, the actual may vary depending on the outcomes of the Community Action Plans2.3 Objective 3: Empowering women through training and access to creditActivity 3.1: Mobilization of Women\'s GroupsWomen\'s organizations like the Women\'s Rural Development Societies that were existed and functioned in very rudimentary form before the war and during the war will be reconstituted and strengthened with capacity building and awareness to realize their rights and responsibilities. In the areas where women\'s groups do not exist, new groups would be formed bringing community women together to work on their common problems and aspirations.Activity 3.2: Preparation of Community Action Plans for Women\'s NeedsA Community Action Planning module will be developed to identify women\'s social and economic needs and the planning workshops will be conducted with women\'s organizations. The project would address their needs within resources available and also link them to other programmes of the Government and other agencies. This will enable women\'s groups to access other sources of resources for example Women\'s Micro Enterprise Credit Guarantee Scheme. The specially designed CAP will also address protection issues that the groups would wish to address.Activity 3.3: Provision of Vocational Training for WomenDepending of the training needs identified in the CAPs, specialized vocational training will be provided for women in vocations where they could work from home as individuals, and from multipurpose community centers as groups. In certain areas experienced Japanese NGO APCAS will be assigned under the project carry out training activities.Activity 3.4: Introduction of Savings and CreditGroup savings and credit will be introduced to women\'s groups to build on their traditional thrift and also to address their immediate credit needs.  The Women\'s Bank with extensive experience country wide will be assigned under the project to carry out the mobilization and organization of savings and credit groups.Output 3.1.1: 10 Women\'s Community Groups establishedOutput 3.2.1: 90 Community Action Plans identifying women\'s needOutput 3.3.1: 1600 Women trained in different vocations identified by them Output 3.4.1: 90 Savings and Credit Groups established2.4 Objective 4: Relearning to live with elephants by supporting communities with innovative protection methods in the villages bordering forests reservesActivity 4.1: Preparation of Community Action Plans to live with elephantsA module of Community Action Planning will be designed for communities to reflect on how they used to live with elephants, the problems that they face with elephants and the methods to mitigate the problems. Although The Department of Wild Life has allocated funding for certain villages for electric fencing, large number of villages remain unattended. Officials of the Department of Wild Life will be part of CAP workshops so that their experience and knowledge will be share with the communities. Activity 4.2:  Establish mitigation measures to keep elephants away Mitigation method would include electrical fencing, bio-fencing. Digging of water holes for elephants away from villages and provision of salt could be other options.Output 4.1.1: Community Action Plans to live with elephants for 3 villages prepared and 9 awareness programmes for community members in the elephant habitat areas conducted.Output 4.1.2: Mitigation measures to keep elephants away from harming villages established in 3 villages\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-04-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-03-31\",\"sector\":\"Strengthening civil society\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-04-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-03-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-04-01\",\"value\":3673178}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":1246709,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":3638294,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"LK\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2560\":{\"title\":\"Safer Cities Programme In Suleimaniyah, Kurdistan Region\",\"description\":\"The purpose of thisproject is to pilot this innovative approach and, through a bottom-up approach,document and up-scale it to the regional level and promote it to other cities.Theproject will seek to protect human rights and enhance the rule of law inKurdistan Region by assisting governments and communities to prevent and reduceof violence and insecurity in targeted locations.

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida\\/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district\\/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2015-01-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2015-01-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":308481}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":803346,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":308481,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"LB\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2579\":{\"title\":\"Enhancing The Role Of Union Of Municipalities To Respond To Refugees\' And Host Communities\' Needs In Beirut\\/Mt Lebanon\",\"description\":\"Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled \\u201cGood governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon\\u201d which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process.

In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida\\/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district\\/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2014-06-30\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2014-06-30\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":348178}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":347689,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":348178,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"LB\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2580\":{\"title\":\"Rapid Shelter Recovery Assistance To Communities Most Severely Hit By Floods Caused By Cyclones Wutip And Nari In Cambodia\",\"description\":\"The proposed shelter activities are akick-off for UN-Habitat\'s project \\u2018Low cost resilient housing and alternativelivelihoods\' which is currently under formulation.

Suchcapacity will be enhanced by localising and promoting the Global HousingStrategy (GHS) that was approved by UN-Habitat Member States in 2011, throughGC Res. 23\\/16. The GHS encourages theformation and participatory management of multilateral partnerships at thenational and local level to ensure a \\u201clevel playing field\\u201d of negotiations,through the creation of National Habitat Committees; the enrichment of theglobal strategy by localised, contextualised successful projects, programmesand strategies and; more importantly, the promotion of inclusive, gender based,rights based equity measures for the urban poor. The GHS therefore assumes adouble tracked approach: it is neither top-down nor bottom-up, but rather triesto instigate horizontal governance at all levels of intervention.The GHS builds on the Global Strategy forShelter to the Year 2000 (GSS2000), which was approved by 158 Member Statesbetween 1988 and 2000 and implemented by UN-Habitat in collaboration withHabitat Agenda partners. Several lessonshave been drawn from this former global initiative, notably that thecommodification of housing and the prevalence of market-dominated housingproduction have negatively impacted the availability of affordable housingsupply. Additionally, generalized urban sprawl, the promotion of home ownershipover other tenure modalities coupled with the failure of housing markets toadequately respond to a variety of demands have contributed to increasingeconomic inequality and a divide between developed and under developed urbanareas. The GHS seeks to readdress issues encountered inthe implementation of the GSS2000 at global and country levels, mainly in thecritical developing regions aforementioned, where inequalities and urbanpoverty are more manifest and have had a greater impact on access to adequateand affordable housing. This project will enable the practical roll-outof the Strategy and the development of related capacity in six Least DevelopedCountries. The project will draw on global processes to formulate housing andslum upgrading strategies that integrate the above concerns, implementingUN-Habitat\'s Global Housing Strategy at country-level. Six countries will beselected across the three regions of Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America andthe Caribbean, as per the criteria outlined in section 2.2 below.The Project will also adopt aregional approach of capacity building.

Enhanced South-South cooperation will be sought to supportcapacity development in each country, and the replication and scaling up of theinitiative in additional countries of each region. At the global level, it isexpected that this approach will result not only in the (re)positioning ofhousing within the global contemporary debate on economically viable,environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive cities but also on criticaloutputs such as: shift in thinking and practice; systemic reforms promoted;strengthened linkages of housing with other parts of the economy; anddecentralization of housing production and delivery systems.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-06-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-09-30\",\"sector\":\"Housing policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-06-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-09-30\",\"value_date\":\"2014-06-01\",\"value\":629000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":130024,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":650,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}]},\"41120-2649\":{\"title\":\"Mekong Region Water And Sanitation (Mek-Watsan) Initiative In Vilabouly Town In Lao Pdr\",\"description\":\"This project covers urban and peri-urban areas of Vilabouly Townin the Province of Savannakhet.

Themain steps were the following:1989: Adoption of the National Housing Strategy that covered allhousing components and produced a set of recommendations that governed theJordanian housing sector\'s activities for 20 years.1992: Merging of former Housing Corporation and UrbanDevelopment Department to form the HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION(HUDC) to become the official umbrella for the housing sector. HUDC wasmandated to work in two areas: housing production and housing policies. 1996: Launching of the Housing Reform Project that addressed themajor issues of the housing sector. The main accomplishments of the reformwere:    establishment of Jordan Mortgage      Refinance Company  granting the private sector rights to      use standards (plot sizes) developed by HUDC  launching partnership with the private      sector,   changing zoning criteria : re-zoning and      down zoning for smaller plots  cancellation of the Housing Bank law to      encourages banking competition in housing finance  rationalizing of housing subsidies.TheHUDC\'s mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activatepublic-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to accessadequate housing, A second function of HUDC would be Detailed Action Planningin collaboration with MOMA (UPD) and municipalities, for selected urban areas.This task should be financed by the clients\\/beneficiaries. It will entail:. identifying with municipalities areas envisaged for future housingdevelopment;. liaising with UPD to review their macro-zoning plans;. preparing action plans (trunk infrastructure development) for priorityareas.  Solving this problem is a priority for two reasons. The first is the high numbers of refugeesthat have arrived in Jordan, all of whom need somewhere to stay. It is unlikely that there will be a swiftsolution to the Syrian crisis, and it is anticipated that Syrian refugees arelikely to stay in in Jordan for at least the next 5-10 years. A solution that providesadequate housingat scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both ofwhom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the comingyears.The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families arefinding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housingfor young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supplyis becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.The solution contained in this programme will address both elements ofthis immediate problem. Jordanians, whohave the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their owndown payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgagerepayment. Although smaller than currenthousing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded oncethe mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian andother refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rentalhousing at affordable rates.The proposal is toconstruct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed tobe convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line withexisting market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families inthe near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation andlegislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may beconstructed individually on an owner\'s existing land, as well as on a largerscale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tractscontributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of theoverall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, crosssubsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially theoverall affordable unit cost). As initiallycontemplated, the owner\\/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at marketrates. Purchase cost is expected to beJD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, inorder to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanianfamily in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser mayreceive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the marketrate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordablerent) [direct from government][direct from donors\\/government] with respect tothe loan in question. Depending on finaldeterminations of construction costs, affordability and local bank capacity,other financial subsidies may be applied, some of which are discussed below.The individual owner will undertake usual landlord roles to ensure that theproperty is maintained and the tenant pays rent on time, in order that theowner\'s loan at the bank remains current through the combined receipt of therent collection and the interest subsidy. The programme objective is toconstruct 30,000 new units over 3 years that will be privately financed, yet availableat affordable rent levels for refugee or vulnerable Jordanian family housing.The primary stakeholders of this programme are Jordanian families (aslandlords), refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families (as tenants).The Jordanian families will be owners and landlords of the small rentalproperties, providing either their own land for construction, or purchasingland to construct up to two units or buying from a developer up to twocompleted units of housing. They willmanage the rental property (undertaking maintenance and rent collection) andwill apply the rental income to debt service.Small and mid-sized developers and construction firms will be encouragedto participate in the programme.Refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families in need of low cost rentalhousing will be tenants of the housing units, paying rent at an affordablelevel linked to the owner\'s mortgage repayment amount.Local banks and financial institutions will provide mortgage financingfor up to ten years, potentially complemented by subsidy or guarantee elementsprovided (by donors or government) that will reduce interest rates or improve loanto value ratios, in order to provide opportunity to lower and middle incomeJordanians to participate who might not otherwise be able to finance anadditional housing unit.The Government of Jordan and donors will also be stakeholders. They mayprovide a subsidy or or other incentive to increase the supply of adequate housing. If resources are sufficient, thesestakeholders may also provide an additional subsidy to the Jordanian owners asinducement to house a refugee or vulnerable family, for example in the form ofa conditional partial loan paydown after an agreed length of tenancy. The role of the UN and GoJ will be to provideoversight to ensure that the subsidies are applied effectively in order thatthese vulnerable target communities benefit from the stable, affordable rentalhousing provided.The Housing andUrban Development Corporation within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing(MoPWH) will be an important Government counterpart as the lead Governmentinstitution responsible for housing.HUDC\'s mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activatepublic-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to accessadequate housing. HUDC, through theprocess of developing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) indicated itsintention to update the national housing policy, which was originally developedin 1992. This project will work closelywith HUDC to develop a broad study of the housing market that will feed intoHUDC\'s broader policy reform agenda.This, combined with the additional detailed studies to be undertakenduring the project, will provide valuable evidence to support policyreforms.The Ministry forMunicipal Affairs (MoMA) also plays an important role in housing supply. It includes an Urban Planning Department thatdesigns and approves land-use plans for all municipalities with the exceptionof the largest ones (such as Amman and Aqaba). They play an important role inensuring that humanitarian and popular responses to the refugee crisis do notexacerbate urban sprawl, which is 7 times more expensive to service than morecompact models of development. TheProgramme will provide housing construction incentives for development to occurin more compact and sustainable forms.Broaderstakeholder consultations have confirmed that there is significant interest inthe initiative. The Municipalities ofSahel Horan, Serhan and Ramtha (all heavily impacted by the refugee crisis)have identified municipal land close to the city centres that they wish todevelop for housing. They have requestedUN-Habitat support, however, to: (i) improve the building designs and layout;(ii) structure the financing; (iii) review various management options (eg.rental housing) that would provide them with a sustainable revenue stream. Thus, the project will also help reduce thedeficits that plague many Jordanian municipalities. UN-Habitat has just started a municipalcreditworthiness programme to help improve municipal finances and these twoprogrammes will complement each other.Positive meetingshave also been held with the Central Bank, commercial banks anddevelopers. The Central Bank confirmedthat commercial banks have significant capacity to increase term lending forhousing within their loan portfolios.Commercial banks have indicated their interest in developing new loanproducts for this market segment, but are not yet sure how to engage with thisnew group of \\u201cclients\\u201d. Commercial banksin Jordan have, in aggregate, the needed term funding to meet the anticipatedfinancing needs of this $450 million programme.Developers have confirmed the feasibility of designing a house to thespecifications provided and at the price indicated (JD12,000 or $15,000). A Jordanian institute has expressed itsinterest to sponsor a national design competition to promote more compact,affordable and livable urban housing.Additionalstakeholders may also include humanitarian NGOs. NRC and Premi\\u00e8re Urgence, for example, haveapproached UN-Habitat to identify how its emergency shelter grant may becomplemented by an affordable housing loan.Similar consultations will also be held with other NGOs which havealready secured grant funding for housing rehabilitation. In both cases, the limited scale and focus ofhumanitarian funding can be complemented by more development orientedfunding. By combining humanitarian anddevelopment funding, this programme will achieve outcomes more in line with theright to \\u201cadequate housing\\u201d.UN-Habitat is providing knowledge services in terms of programmedelivery and the leveraging and alignment of government support.

Thenational urban policy provides an overarching coordinating framework to addressthe most pressing issues related to rapid urban development, including slumprevention and regularization, access to land, basic services and infrastructure,urban legislation, delegation of authority to subnational and localgovernments, financial flows, urban planning regulations, urban mobility andurban energy requirements, as well as job creation. Approved atthe highest level, a national urban policy should provide the general frameworkto orient public interventions in urban areas and be a reference for sectoralministries and service providers. It should also be the key reference forlegislative institutional reform. The National Urban Planning Policy is also agood instrument for public and political awareness of the gains to be obtainedfrom sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promoteconsultation with urban stakeholders.

While reasonably effective for specific threats, this approach is largely palliative, i.e. defining risk, and retro-fitting remedial measures to reduce it. However, there is no means to test the efficacy of these remedial efforts until another disaster occurs that meets or exceeds the original design limits.Many urban risk reduction initiatives address specific hazards. These are usually well-known (or at least well-publicized), and more recently since the \\u2018climate change agenda\' has become a global, well-funded, and extremely well-articulated agenda including city strategies to cope with a range of climate-driven threats and mitigating their impact on the global climate. However, approaches often ignore other hazards including the largest killers such as earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as automobile accidents, fires and industrial or technological disasters, and social and political crisis.The closest approximation of a tool for building resilience is the UN-ISDR\'s 10 point checklist associated with their Making Cities Resilient (MCR) global Campaign. However, recent testing of this framework reveals its primary weaknesses which derive from a framework of principles that are self-assessed by local governments, and self-driven with no clear standards that planners, engineers, architects, economists, and other experts who manage cities can target and use. The results are qualitative in nature, and while clearly a good foundation for advocating the resilience agenda globally, will demand further strategies and tools to ensure cities actually do become measurably more resilient.While some developments focusing on multi-hazard approaches, such as the one above, are emerging, to date there is no system for defining forward-looking, integrated, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder urban systems approach to planning and developing urban settlements capacity to withstand and recover from crisis, i.e. achieving measurable resilience.The URIP fills a significant sustainable development planning and implementation gap at a time when cities are assuming ever-increasing local, regional, national and global socio-economic significance.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-09-01\",\"end-date\":\"2015-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-09-01\",\"period_end\":\"2015-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-09-01\",\"value\":323154}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":239810,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":301870,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2687\":{\"title\":\"Empowering Urban Development Stakeholders For Engagement At Global Milestones.\",\"description\":\"By 2050, about 70 per cent of the world\'s populationis projected to live in urban areas.

At the same time, handlingland disputes and promoting an effective land governance system enable economicrecovery and help to tackle poverty, which removes one of the causes of ongoingconflict. The linkages between land disputes, peace, stability and economicrecovery require innovative approaches to deal with land issues in a holisticmanner. Tackling land issues will contribute to reconciliation, facilitatereturn and reintegration for IDPs and refugees, reduce the risks of armedconflict, and enable a stable environment for livelihood improvement through secureland tenure and access to means of production. The recognition of thesignificance of land issues is gaining momentum in the agendas of bothstabilization and development actors, and approaches based on lessons derivedfrom previous interventions need to be adapted to the context. 3.1.Land disputes as a symptom of underlying causes andnot as an end in themselves:Many interventions in the land sector are focusing on dealing with landdisputes through mediation. Mediating land disputes is a necessary step but itis not sufficient. There is a need to tackle the root causes of land disputes,knowing that conflict derives from various factors (legal, ethnic, political,institutions). An innovativeapproach may need to perceive land issues through the lens of governance. Thelack of state authority and the failure of the governance system as a whole haverepercussions on land management and allocation. The former stabilizationframework in Eastern DR Congo (ISSSS) only focused on superficial aspects whilemitigating disputes and conflict over land. The approach did not, however, seriouslyconsider land conflicts as a matter of governance.3.2.Long-term approach to comprehensively deal withland issuesA humanitarian approach to dealing with land issues in post conflictsettings prevailed in the case of DR Congo. Actors were mainly targeting quicksolutions through ad hocinterventions without developing a long-term vision for the land sector. Aneffective long-term vision requires the development of a realistic agenda that takesa comprehensive approach and links land issues with other critical sectors for peace and stability,such as security, decentralization and the restoration of state authority.The long-term solution in DR Congo on land issues is to reconcilelegitimacy and legality regarding land management and governance. The ongoingland reform process led by the national government becomes an avenue to capturechanges in the land governance system and to reach durable solutions to theland conflicts. According to the strategic plan developed in 2013, the GoDRC isexpected to come up with a new land policy from which should derive a new landlegal framework adapted to the new context of the DRC, and this by end of 2016.But due to some delay on the land program implementation this timeline needs tobe reviewed to be realistic. But in the meantime, some keys can be addressed aslong as the government is committed (regulation of land customary rights,recognition of alternative disputes resolution mechanisms as part of theinstitutional framework.3.3.Scaling up experiences from local to national:Until now, most interventions dealing with land issues focus on thecommunity level with weak linkages to provincial and national levels. Working with local communities should notexclude certain levels of cooperation with both the provincial and nationallevels. Evidence has shown that powerfulactors with influence at the local level of the political crisis in DR Congoare not necessarily themselves present on the ground. Some are based in capitalsof provinces while others are in Kinshasa occupying political functions; usingproxy means to manage their interests at the local level. 3.4.Weakness of interventions in the land sector:Most of the interventions in the land sector are carried out by localNGOs, mainly focusing on land dispute resolution. The number of NGOs is verylimited taking into account the number of land disputes emerging at thecommunity level. Some community members do not have access to formal or wellorganized dispute resolution mechanisms in the areas covered by UN-Habitatprogram (For example, Irumu and Mombassa Territories in Ituri,, Haut Plateauxin South Kivu). Disequilibrium in the geographical coverage may lead todisharmony in the treatment of land issues, leading only to partial solutionsto the problem. At the same time, many NGOs lack the technical capacity to deal withland issues. Based of the inherent sensitivity of land issues, actors workingat the community level require a minimum expertise to avoid doing harm whendealing with land disputes. Land interventions will always have the potentialto aggravate conflicts. Buildingcapacity for both community members and local organizations is a perquisite fora successful resolution of land disputes.Despites progress made with regards to the perception of importance ofland for peace and stability in the DR Congo through the various frameworks,interventions are still limited in terms of investment. In 2010, the UN Peace Building Fundsallocated 900 000 USD to only one land program amidst large demand on landdisputes resolution at the community level. The funding covered only twoterritories in North Kivu (Masisi and Rutshuru).

Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO\'s engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida\\/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: - Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. - Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.The strategy would include the following:At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district\\/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees.

These aim at (i)developing a universally applicable reference framework for national urbanpolicy reforms; (ii) capturing universal principles from national experiencesthat could support the development of a diversity of planning approachesadapted to different contexts and scales; (iii) complementing and linking otherinternational guidelines aiming at fostering sustainable urban development;(iv) raising the urban and territorial dimensions in the development agendas ofnational, provincial and local governments.(b) Promotethe development and implementation of a new generation of national urbanpolicies (including regional and metropolitan planning strategies) forsustainable urban development. The development of a national urban policy isthe key step for reasserting urban space and territoriality and for providingthe needed direction and course of action to support urban development. Thenational urban policy provides an overarching coordinating framework to addressthe most pressing issues related to rapid urban development, including slumprevention and regularization, access to land, basic services and infrastructure,urban legislation, delegation of authority to subnational and localgovernments, financial flows, urban planning regulations, urban mobility andurban energy requirements, as well as job creation. Approved atthe highest level, a national urban policy should provide the general frameworkto orient public interventions in urban areas and be a reference for sectoralministries and service providers. It should also be the key reference forlegislative institutional reform. The National Urban Planning Policy is also agood instrument for public and political awareness of the gains to be obtainedfrom sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promoteconsultation with urban stakeholders. Successfulnational urban policies generally yield the following results: (a) theidentification of urban development priorities towards socially andeconomically equitable and environmentally friendly urban and nationaldevelopment; (b) guidance on the future development of the national urban systemand its spatial configuration concretized through National and Regional SpatialPlans for Territorial Development; (c) better coordination and guidance ofactions by national actors, as well as lower levels of government in allsectors; (d) increased and more coordinated private and public investments inurban development and consequent improvement of cities productivity,inclusiveness and environmental conditions. (c) Buildand harness capacity at metropolitan, regional, national and global levels, supportedby dedicated strategies and programmes, including human resources development,tool development, organizational development and institutional strengthening toachieve sustainable development. An ultimate form of impact at the normativelevel will be achieved through supporting countries in developing theirnational urban policies, as many countries lack these.

Themain steps were the following:1989: Adoption of the National Housing Strategy that covered allhousing components and produced a set of recommendations that governed theJordanian housing sector\'s activities for 20 years.1992: Merging of former Housing Corporation and UrbanDevelopment Department to form the HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION(HUDC) to become the official umbrella for the housing sector. HUDC wasmandated to work in two areas: housing production and housing policies. 1996: Launching of the Housing Reform Project that addressed themajor issues of the housing sector. The main accomplishments of the reformwere:    establishment of Jordan Mortgage      Refinance Company  granting the private sector rights to      use standards (plot sizes) developed by HUDC  launching partnership with the private      sector,   changing zoning criteria : re-zoning and      down zoning for smaller plots  cancellation of the Housing Bank law to      encourages banking competition in housing finance  rationalizing of housing subsidies.TheHUDC\'s mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activatepublic-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to accessadequate housing, A second function of HUDC would be Detailed Action Planningin collaboration with MOMA (UPD) and municipalities, for selected urban areas.This task should be financed by the clients\\/beneficiaries. It will entail:. identifying with municipalities areas envisaged for future housingdevelopment;. liaising with UPD to review their macro-zoning plans;. preparing action plans (trunk infrastructure development) for priorityareas.  Solving this problem is a priority for two reasons. The first is the high numbers of refugeesthat have arrived in Jordan, all of whom need somewhere to stay. It is unlikely that there will be a swiftsolution to the Syrian crisis, and it is anticipated that Syrian refugees arelikely to stay in in Jordan for at least the next 5-10 years. A solution that providesadequate housingat scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both ofwhom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the comingyears.The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families arefinding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housingfor young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supplyis becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.The solution contained in this programme will address both elements ofthis immediate problem. Jordanians, whohave the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their owndown payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgagerepayment. Although smaller than currenthousing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded oncethe mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian andother refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rentalhousing at affordable rates.The proposal is toconstruct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed tobe convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line withexisting market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families inthe near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation andlegislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may beconstructed individually on an owner\'s existing land, as well as on a largerscale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tractscontributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of theoverall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, crosssubsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially theoverall affordable unit cost). As initiallycontemplated, the owner\\/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at marketrates. Purchase cost is expected to beJD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, inorder to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanianfamily in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser mayreceive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the marketrate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordablerent) [direct from government][direct from donors\\/government] with respect tothe loan in question. Depending on finaldeterminations of construction costs, affordability and local bank capacity,other financial subsidies may be applied, some of which are discussed below.The individual owner will undertake usual landlord roles to ensure that theproperty is maintained and the tenant pays rent on time, in order that theowner\'s loan at the bank remains current through the combined receipt of therent collection and the interest subsidy. The programme objective is toconstruct 30,000 new units over 3 years that will be privately financed, yet availableat affordable rent levels for refugee or vulnerable Jordanian family housing.The primary stakeholders of this programme are Jordanian families (aslandlords), refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families (as tenants).The Jordanian families will be owners and landlords of the small rentalproperties, providing either their own land for construction, or purchasingland to construct up to two units or buying from a developer up to twocompleted units of housing. They willmanage the rental property (undertaking maintenance and rent collection) andwill apply the rental income to debt service.Small and mid-sized developers and construction firms will be encouragedto participate in the programme.Refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families in need of low cost rentalhousing will be tenants of the housing units, paying rent at an affordablelevel linked to the owner\'s mortgage repayment amount.Local banks and financial institutions will provide mortgage financingfor up to ten years, potentially complemented by subsidy or guarantee elementsprovided (by donors or government) that will reduce interest rates or improve loanto value ratios, in order to provide opportunity to lower and middle incomeJordanians to participate who might not otherwise be able to finance anadditional housing unit.The Government of Jordan and donors will also be stakeholders. They mayprovide a subsidy or or other incentive to increase the supply of adequate housing. If resources are sufficient, thesestakeholders may also provide an additional subsidy to the Jordanian owners asinducement to house a refugee or vulnerable family, for example in the form ofa conditional partial loan paydown after an agreed length of tenancy. The role of the UN and GoJ will be to provideoversight to ensure that the subsidies are applied effectively in order thatthese vulnerable target communities benefit from the stable, affordable rentalhousing provided.The Housing andUrban Development Corporation within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing(MoPWH) will be an important Government counterpart as the lead Governmentinstitution responsible for housing.HUDC\'s mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activatepublic-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to accessadequate housing. HUDC, through theprocess of developing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) indicated itsintention to update the national housing policy, which was originally developedin 1992. This project will work closelywith HUDC to develop a broad study of the housing market that will feed intoHUDC\'s broader policy reform agenda.This, combined with the additional detailed studies to be undertakenduring the project, will provide valuable evidence to support policyreforms.The Ministry forMunicipal Affairs (MoMA) also plays an important role in housing supply. It includes an Urban Planning Department thatdesigns and approves land-use plans for all municipalities with the exceptionof the largest ones (such as Amman and Aqaba). They play an important role inensuring that humanitarian and popular responses to the refugee crisis do notexacerbate urban sprawl, which is 7 times more expensive to service than morecompact models of development. TheProgramme will provide housing construction incentives for development to occurin more compact and sustainable forms.Broaderstakeholder consultations have confirmed that there is significant interest inthe initiative. The Municipalities ofSahel Horan, Serhan and Ramtha (all heavily impacted by the refugee crisis)have identified municipal land close to the city centres that they wish todevelop for housing. They have requestedUN-Habitat support, however, to: (i) improve the building designs and layout;(ii) structure the financing; (iii) review various management options (eg.rental housing) that would provide them with a sustainable revenue stream. Thus, the project will also help reduce thedeficits that plague many Jordanian municipalities. UN-Habitat has just started a municipalcreditworthiness programme to help improve municipal finances and these twoprogrammes will complement each other.Positive meetingshave also been held with the Central Bank, commercial banks anddevelopers. The Central Bank confirmedthat commercial banks have significant capacity to increase term lending forhousing within their loan portfolios.Commercial banks have indicated their interest in developing new loanproducts for this market segment, but are not yet sure how to engage with thisnew group of \\u201cclients\\u201d. Commercial banksin Jordan have, in aggregate, the needed term funding to meet the anticipatedfinancing needs of this $450 million programme.Developers have confirmed the feasibility of designing a house to thespecifications provided and at the price indicated (JD12,000 or $15,000). A Jordanian institute has expressed itsinterest to sponsor a national design competition to promote more compact,affordable and livable urban housing.Additionalstakeholders may also include humanitarian NGOs. NRC and Premi\\u00e8re Urgence, for example, haveapproached UN-Habitat to identify how its emergency shelter grant may becomplemented by an affordable housing loan.Similar consultations will also be held with other NGOs which havealready secured grant funding for housing rehabilitation. In both cases, the limited scale and focus ofhumanitarian funding can be complemented by more development orientedfunding. By combining humanitarian anddevelopment funding, this programme will achieve outcomes more in line with theright to \\u201cadequate housing\\u201d.UN-Habitat is providing knowledge services in terms of programmedelivery and the leveraging and alignment of government support. It is also providing advisory services. Specialized financial services will beprovided for financial structuring, negotiation and delivery through UN-Habitatconsultants.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2015-01-04\",\"end-date\":\"2016-02-29\",\"sector\":\"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2015-01-04\",\"period_end\":\"2016-02-29\",\"value_date\":\"2015-01-04\",\"value\":1050205}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":318080,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":630123,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"JO\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2828\":{\"title\":\"Supporting Habitat Iii Conference (Pooled Funds; Erso, Asud,,,,,)\",\"description\":\"\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2017-01-31\",\"sector\":\"\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2017-01-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":1060235}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":342399,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":500000,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2829\":{\"title\":\"Support To National Habitat Committees From Francophone Least Developed Countries In Africa In Preparation For The Habitat Iii Conference (Govt Of France)\",\"description\":\"\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2017-01-31\",\"sector\":\"\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2017-01-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":121617}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":90218,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":121617,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}]},\"41120-2834\":{\"title\":\"Entrepreneurship And Ict Centre Training For Youth Empowerment\",\"description\":\"The overall objective is to empower youth by capacitybuilding through e-learning and other ICT related methods.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-10-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-04-30\",\"sector\":\"Employment policy and administrative management\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-10-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-04-30\",\"value_date\":\"2014-10-01\",\"value\":460000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":61635,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":383415,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"KE\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2841\":{\"title\":\"Supporting Government Of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa In Developing More Synergised, Cohesive And Inclusive Drm Policies\",\"description\":\"The project purpose is that \\u2018all key disaster managementinstitutions establish effective risk assessment, hazard mapping, coordinationand oversight mechanisms at federal, provincial and district levels addressingthe concerns of vulnerable population\'\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2015-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2015-12-31\",\"sector\":\"Disaster prevention and preparedness\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2015-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2015-12-31\",\"value_date\":\"2015-01-01\",\"value\":201207}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":6543,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":201207,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"PK\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2857\":{\"title\":\"Humanitarian Support To Idps In The Republic Of Iraq Including The Kurdistan Region Of Iraq Through Provision Of Durable Shelter\",\"description\":\"Necessityof the interventionThe Government of Iraq and the KurdistanRegional Government have been jointly responding to the large influx of IDPsinto major Governorates in Iraq. The governments prioritized to mobilizeresources and support to provide appropriate shelters to IDPs, while the UnitedNations Humanitarian Coordination Team in Iraq also stressed the importance ofmid-term solution to needs of IDPs, both based on an understanding that securityunrest in Iraq needs to be solved in longer term. Despite the urgency of needfor convenient and durable IDP shelters, the governments have been facingfinancial and institutional constraints to respond to large number of IDPs inIraq.Emergency of the situation  The Islamic State has been expanding itsactivities and control in Iraq and Syria. Their adroit media strategy usinginternet and social media resulted in increase of numbers of the Islamic Statefighters recruited globally. Despite a series of international interventionincluding air campaigns led by the United States, the Islamic State groupcontinues to expand its territorial control. This situation implies that thenumber of IDPs in Iraq and Syria may continue to increase. Some of the majorcities in Iraq already have same number of IDPs as their original population,and communities hosting IDPs are already under severe pressure with regard to infrastructure and basic services. Therefore,providing durable shelters to IDPs is an emergency requirement in Iraq.Unpredictability of the situationIn August 2014, the IS attacks on theYazidi community and the Christian minorities in northern Iraq triggered theinternal displacement of some 800,000 persons into three governorates of theKRI, namely Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Within a month between August andSeptember 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) more thanquintupled from 96,000 to 520,000 in Dohuk, and increased by 150 per cent from117,000 to 170,000 in Erbil.Such exponential increase ofIDPs in Iraq is mainly due to emergence of the extremists group called itselfthe Islamic State and the resulting deterioration of security, which became aserious concern only recently and was not predictable.Non-Substitutability of the interventionProvision of prefabricated durable sheltersto IDPs is the most suitable solution that addresses challenges faced by IDPsand host communities. Continuing to provide tents without basic services is nota feasible solution in medium term, because tents are not designed to last forthe long period and have to be replaced every eight months. It is also notsuitable to accommodate IDPs during the winter or extreme weather conditions insummer. Lack of basic infrastructure such as water, latrines, sanitation andelectricity in the camp site will lead to cause more problems among the IDPsand host communities. Both the governments and international agencies haveagreed that the provision of prefabricated durable shelters and basic servicesis critical.\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2015-03-01\",\"end-date\":\"2016-02-29\",\"sector\":\"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2015-03-01\",\"period_end\":\"2016-02-29\",\"value_date\":\"2015-03-01\",\"value\":15000000}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":18109,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":15000000,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"IQ\",\"percentage\":100}]},\"41120-2862\":{\"title\":\"Supporting Habitat Iii Conference (Pooled Funds; Erso, Asud)\",\"description\":\"According to General Assembly Resolution A\\/Res\\/66\\/207: To reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainableurbanization that should focus on the implementation of a \\u201cNew Urban Agenda\\u201d,which should build on the Habitat Agenda, the Declaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in the New Millennium and the relevant internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration,and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, and the outcomes of other major United Nations conferences and summits;\",\"currency\":\"USD\",\"status\":\"Implementation\",\"start-date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"end-date\":\"2017-01-31\",\"sector\":\"\",\"budget\":[{\"period_start\":\"2014-01-01\",\"period_end\":\"2017-01-31\",\"value_date\":\"2014-01-01\",\"value\":1060235}],\"transactions\":[{\"code\":\"E\",\"value\":522850,\"description\":\"Total expenditure to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"},{\"code\":\"IF\",\"value\":670068,\"description\":\"Total income to date\",\"date\":\"2015-04-01\"}],\"countries\":[{\"iso2\":\"WW\",\"percentage\":100}]}},\"cnt\":383},\"sectors\":21,\"countries\":65,\"iati_url\":\"http:\\/\\/mirror.unhabitat.org\\/downloads\\/docs\\/open_unhabitat_org\\/UN-habitat_projects.xml\",\"org\":{\"name\":\"UN-Habitat\",\"ref\":\"41120\"}}', '2017-03-20 03:07:34', '0');
